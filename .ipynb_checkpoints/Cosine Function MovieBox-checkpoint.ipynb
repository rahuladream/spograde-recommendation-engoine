       " 'plots': ['Set in the second half of the 22nd century, the film depicts Mars as a planet that has been 84% terraformed, allowing humans to walk on the surface without wearing pressure suits. The Martian society has become largely matriarchal, with women in most positions of authority. The story concerns a police officer, Melanie Ballard , second in command of a small team alongside Sergeant Jericho  sent to pick up and transport a prisoner named Desolation Williams . Arriving at the remote mining town where Williams is being held, Ballard finds virtually all of the people missing. She learns that the miners had discovered an underground doorway created by an ancient Martian civilization. When the door was opened it released \"ghosts,\" disembodied spirits which possessed the miners. Violence ensues, as the possessed miners commit horrific acts of death and destruction, as well as self-mutilation. With their team leader Helena Bradock  murdered, Ballard must fight off the attacking miners, escape the town, and destroy the ghosts, if possible. Unfortunately, her intentions are complicated by the fact that killing a possessed human merely releases the Martian spirit to possess another human. The team eventually decides to blow up a nuclear reactor to try and vaporize all of the ghosts. At several points in the film Sergeant Jericho shows a romantic interest in Ballard, mostly unreciprocated. Ballard\\'s crew along with survivors who manage to gather in the jail are eventually wiped out by the miners after many fierce battles and events , leaving only her and Williams after Sergeant Jericho and the other remaining officers and the two operators of the train are killed upon returning from a brief retreat to finish the fight. Not wanting the authorities to blame the massacre on him, he handcuffs Ballard to her cot and escapes from the train, leaving her to return home and deliver her report, which is received with skepticism by her superiors. While Ballard recuperates at a hospital, the released spirits, who weren\\'t destroyed after all, attack the city. The end scene sets the movie up for a sequel as Williams returns to team up with Ballard to fight the possessed.',\n",
       "  'A series of murders of rich young women throughout Arizona bear distinctive signatures of a serial killer. Clues lead Detective Charles Mendoza to visit Paul White, a sound expert installing hi-fi systems in wealthy people\\'s homes. His special talent is to make a noise which echoes through the air cavities in his head and shows him where the sound of the speakers should come from and echo in the room. He is married to Joan, whom, ten years earlier, he had seduced away from Mike DeSantos, her then current boyfriend. Joan is questioned by Mendoza, but does not believe his insinuations that her husband is somehow involved in the murders. Various flashbacks show Joan\\'s previous relationship to Mike and later explain how it came to be that he abandoned her. The couple met Paul and befriended him. At Mike\\'s suggestion, he and Mike go on a deer hunting trip together. Paul shoots a deer and brutally mutilates it, demonstrating his sick fascination with killing. This is partly intended to scare Mike off, which it does. Mike catches Joan and Paul after they\\'ve made love, and Paul declares that he will take Mike\\'s place. \"I am the one,\" Paul says. Mike puts his gun at the back of Paul\\'s head but decides not to kill and abandons Joan. By now Joan has run into Mike DeSantos working at a gas station in a neighboring town. Mike tells her he got out of prison after suffering a major head injury; he thinks life is looking up. He makes her promise not to tell Paul that she has seen him. Joan soon discovers Paul has committed adultery. By puncturing Paul\\'s tires she provides him with an alibi for the most recent killing. He begs her forgiveness as the police turn their suspicions away from him. At home, Joan looks into a crawl space in the house, and discovers preserved body parts of Paul\\'s victims wrapped in paper and plastic. Joan confronts Paul, and Paul tries to explain his motivations for killing. He believes he has been \"chosen\" and is expressing the nothingness of the universe, whose heart is female and destructive like a black hole. He is putting women \"out of their misery,\" but he loves Joan. Joan\\'s distrust of Mike over the next night and day agitates him into a fury. First, he tries to imprison her and then kill her and his daughter. He heavily arms himself and paints his face to look like a samurai warrior or an Indian brave. Joan and the little girl escape in different directions and soon Joan has to elude Paul in the abandoned quarry. It turns out Mike has been staying there, armed with a machine gun, certain that he will meet Paul again. He rescues Joan and takes away Paul\\'s gun, leading him to the edge of the quarry. Paul makes the sound he uses in the emptiness of living rooms and savors its echo from the quarry. While incessantly pontificating about his philosophies of life and death, Paul reveals a lighter with which he has lit the fuse of his explosive vest. Mike opens fire on him with a machine gun and Joan dives into the lake in the quarry. Paul and Mike both die instantly, in a hail of destruction. Joan is reunited later with her daughter. She talks with Detective Mendoza about what the ten years with Paul could have meant, whose destructive and nihilistic nature she never understood. Based on the 1983 novel Mrs White by Margaret Tracy .',\n",

Consequently, they move into his penthouse, large enough for both of them to offer their services separately. Then slowly Eva enters the world of sado-masochism. She finds being a dominatrix extremely satisfying, and begins to take pleasure in controlling others and causing them intense pain. She discovers this in a scene in which a man is hiding under a table. Eva can see that his hands are sticking out from under the table and are clearly visible. Coldly, and with intense inner satisfaction, Eva proceeds to crush the man\\'s hands by slowly walking over them with her stiletto-heeled boots. Chris, the gigolo begins getting jealous of her, wants to know what\\'s going on upstairs and why she\\'s making so much money. She tells him it\\'s from hurting men, and the more she hurts them, the more money she gets. This upsets him greatly. She also becomes jealous of his boyfriend/client, a man who\\'s been coming to him for many years. The scenes in the upstairs room intensify. One day he sneaks up and observers her in a scene dominating a man tied to a chair. He has a look on his face like \"see, this is what you truly are,\" and the look on her face says proudly \"yes, this is what I truly am.\" He tries to whisk her away from all of it, buying her furs, talking about marriage. She tells him that she\\'s been dreaming about hitting him, and in the dream he likes it. The setting is all there for a romantic ending, and yet, he panics, he takes all their money and invests it in a restaurant that she doesn\\'t want to be part of. She tries to walk out on him, and he gets angry, throws her against the wall, hits her, pours alcohol on her, and lights her on fire. But the last scene shows her unscathed, happy with her friend the sex worker/madame, and they\\'re getting thrown out of a bar that Chris owns. The movie thus extols female independence from men, though in its ending stops short of endorsing a female-dominant/male-submissive romance.',\n",

       "  ' The story starts as one of the robots flies into a scientist\\'s secret lair and unloads a pile of cash into a vault. The robot is controlled completely from the scientists command center, and we see that he is one of many robots similar to him, lined up along the walls of the lair. Next, we see the front page of the Daily Planet, reporting the \"mechanical monsters\" robbery right alongside an announcement for the display of 50&nbsp;million dollars of the world\\'s rarest gems at the local museum.  Later, as Lois and Clark are covering the museum\\'s exhibit for the Planet, a robot lands in the street outside. The police pelt it with machine gun fire as it marches towards the museum, but the bullets bounce harmlessly off. Museum visitors, including Clark and Lois, flee as the monster marches towards the jewels and begins loading them into an opening in its back. While Clark phones the Planet from the nearest phone booth, Lois climbs into the monster\\'s back, just as the monster leaves the museum and takes off into the sky. Clark emerges from the booth, notices Lois gone, and says, \"This is a job for Superman!\" He goes back into the phone booth and changes his clothes, emerging in his classic red-and-blue costume. Flying high above the city, Superman spots the robot and uses his X-ray vision to see Lois inside with the jewels.  He lands on it and struggles to open the door in its back, only to have the scientist maneuver the robot upside down and throw him off into a power line, tangling him in the wires. As the robot is upside down, the door flies open and all the jewels fall out, with Lois surviving only by hanging for dear life until the robot flips back over. As Superman struggles to free himself from the wires, the robot arrives at the lair, but instead of jewels, the scientist finds Lois in its payload. Infuriated, he demands that she tell him where the jewels are. The next time we see her, she is bound and gagged on a platform held over a pot of boiling metal in part of what appears to be an industrial foundry. The scientist pulls a lever which starts some machinery gradually lowering her closer and closer to the liquid. Meanwhile, Superman frees himself from the power lines and knocks down the door to the scientist\\'s lair, only to meet the army of robots . Under the scientist\\'s control, the robots emit fire from nozzles positioned on the lower part of their heads, encircle Superman, and pound him with their fists. Initially, the robots seem to have the upper hand, beating Superman to the ground, but Superman defeats them, sending the scientist running. When Superman catches up with him, he is holding a knife to the rope holding Lois\\' platform above the molten metal, and threatens to cut it if he takes another step. Superman makes a move, the rope is cut, and Superman speeds across the room to catch Lois just in time, landing on a ledge below the pot of molten metal and the scientist. The scientist then pulls a lever to dump the hot liquid on them, but Superman shields Lois with his cape, then grabs the scientist and flies from the lair to take him and Lois back to the city. The film ends with a shot of the next issue of the Planet, describing the latest adventure -- Superman stopped the mechanical monsters, the scientist was arrested and the jewels are recovered. In the office, Clark says \"That\\'s a wonderful story, Lois.\" She replies, \"Thanks Clark, but I owe it all to Superman.\" Clark smiles.',\n",
       "  'The film opens with Mary Poppins  perched in a cloud high above London in spring 1910.\"... It\\'s grand to be an Englishman in 1910 / King Edward\\'s on the throne; it\\'s the age of men! ...\" George Banks\\' opening song \\'The Life I Lead\\'; King Edward VII of the United Kingdom died 6 May 1910 The action descends to Earth where Bert , a Cockney jack-of-all-trades is performing as a one-man band at a park entrance. The spectators watching him include: Ms. Persimmon , Miss Lark  and Mrs. Corry . He suddenly senses that his good friend is about to return. After the show, he speaks directly to the audience, introducing viewers first to Admiral Boom, who keeps his exterior rooftop \"Ship Shape\", by firing his cannon at 8:AM and 6:PM each day, and then to the well-to-do but troubled Banks family, headed by the cold and aloof George Banks  and the loving but highly distracted suffragette Winifred Banks . The Bankses\\' latest nanny, Katie Nanna , is quitting, exasperated after the Banks children, Jane  and Michael , have run off for the fourth time this week. Ellen, the maid , pleads with her not to leave, but Mrs. Brill, the cook , wishes her good riddance. Mrs. Banks returns home, and engages all four women in a rousing rendition of \"Sister Suffragette\", before Katie Nanna stalks out. Mr. Banks returns home from his job at the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, and Mrs. Banks reveals the children are missing. A policeman , arrives with the children, who ask their father to help repair their damaged kite, but he dismisses them and advertises for an authoritarian nanny-replacement. Jane and Michael draft their own advertisement asking for a fun, kind-hearted and caring person, but Mr. Banks tears up the paper and throws it in the fireplace. Unnoticed, the remains of the note float up the dark chimney. The next day, a queue of elderly and disagreeable looking candidates await at the door. However, a strong gust of wind blows the queue away and Mary Poppins floats down, held aloft by her magical umbrella, to apply. Mr. Banks is stunned to see that this calmly defiant new nanny has responded to the children\\'s ad despite the fact he destroyed it. Although Mary Poppins recites the ad, she also tells George that she is firm and will also lay down ground rules with the children. As he puzzles, Mary Poppins employs herself and begins work, saying that she will stay for a trial period of one week, before deciding if she will take a permanent position. The children face surprises of their own: Mary possesses a bottomless carpetbag, and makes contents of the children\\'s nursery come to life and tidy themselves . The trio then meet Bert, who is a close friend of Mary, in the park at work as a screever, where Mary uses one of his chalk pavement drawings as a gateway to an outing in an animated countryside. While in the drawing, the children ride a merry-go-round while Mary and Bert enjoy a stroll through the countryside, during which Bert dances at an outdoor bistro with four penguin waiters. Mary and Bert join the children on the merry-go-round, from which the horses break loose and take their riders on a trip through the countryside. As they pass by a fox hunt, Bert maneuvers to save an Irish-accented fox from the bloodhounds. Finally the quartet finds themselves in a horse race, which Mary wins. It is here that Mary first employs the nonsense word \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.\" The outing is interrupted by a rainstorm, which washes away the chalk drawing and returns the travellers, drenched, to the park pavement. That evening, the children ask Mary how long she\\'ll stay with them. With a somber expression, she replies, \"I shall stay until the wind changes\". The next day, they all visit Bert\\'s jovial Uncle Albert , who floats whenever he laughs, and join him in a tea party in mid-air, though Mary finds it childish and ridiculous. They all get down, only when one had to think of \"Something Sad\", when Mary firmly says: \"It is time to go home.\" Mr. Banks grows increasingly irate with his children\\'s stories of their adventures, but Mary effortlessly inverts his attempted dismissal of her services into a plan to take his children with him to the Dawes Tomes Mousley Grubbs Fidelity Fiduciary Bank, where he is employed. On the way there, as they pass the bank, the children see \"The Bird Woman\" , of whom Mary sang to them the night before, and they want to feed the birds around her, but George will have none of it as he expresses his lack of interest in what Mary Poppins says and orders his children to \"come along\" and not mention her name for the rest of the day. Upon arriving at the bank, Mr. Dawes Jr  and Mr. Dawes Sr —Mr. Banks\\' employers—aggressively try to persuade Michael to invest his tuppence in the bank to the point of actually snatching it out of his hand without waiting for his permission. When Michael protests, the other customers misunderstand and start a run on the bank that forces the bank to suspend business. The Bank Guard  chases the children causing the children to flee and wander into the slums of the East End of London. Fortunately, they run into Bert, now employed as a chimney sweep. He takes them safely home, explaining that their father does not hate them, but that he has problems of his own, and that unlike the children, has no one to turn to but himself. At home, a departing Mrs. Banks employs Bert to clean the family\\'s chimney and mind the children. Mary Poppins arrives back from her day off and warns of the dangers of this activity, but is too late as the children are both sucked up the chimney to the roof. Bert and Mary follow them and lead a tour of the rooftops of London that concludes with a joyful dance with Bert\\'s chimney-sweep colleagues. A volley of fireworks from the Banks\\' eccentric neighbour, Admiral Boom , who mistakes them for Hottentots, orders Mr. Binnacle  to set off the fireworks which sends the entire gathering back down a different chimney, which turns out to be the Banks\\' chimney. Mr. Banks arrives home, causing the chimney sweepers to depart outside the home, and out into the street, where they disappear from view within less than half a minute. Their departure conclude the festivities. Banks angrily inquires Mary Poppins what was the meaning of this, in which Mary replies that she never explains anything. Banks then receives a phone call from work ordering him to return immediately for disciplinary action. As Mr. Banks gathers his strength, Bert points out that while Mr. Banks does need to make a living, his offspring\\'s childhood will come and go in a blink of an eye, and he needs to be there for them while he can. The Banks children approach their father to apologize, and Michael gives Mr. Banks his tuppence in the hope that it will make things all right. Banks gently accepts the offering. A somber and thoughtful Mr. Banks walks alone through the night-time streets, for the first time noticing several of the buildings around him, including the cathedral and steps on which the bird woman was sitting earlier. At the bank, he is formally humiliated and sacked for causing the first run on the bank since 1773 . However, after being at a loss when ordered to give a statement, Mr. Banks invokes Mary Poppins\\' all-purpose word \"Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!\" to tweak Mr. Dawes. He gives Dawes the tuppence, tells the old man one of Bert\\'s and Uncle Albert\\'s jokes, and raucously departs. Dawes mulls over the joke, finally \"gets it\" and floats up into the air, laughing. The next morning, the wind has changed direction, and so Mary must depart. Meanwhile, the Banks adults cannot find Mr. Banks, and fear that he might have become suicidal. However, Mr. Banks, now loving and joyful, reappears with the now-mended kite and cheerfully summons his children. The greatly relieved Mrs. Banks supplies a tail for the kite, using one of her suffragette ribbons. They all leave the house without a backward glance as Mary Poppins watches from a window. In the park with other kite-flyers, Mr. Banks meets Mr. Dawes Jr., now in charge of the bank, who says that his father literally died laughing. Instead of being upset, the son is delighted his father died happy and re-employs Mr. Banks to fill the opening as junior partner. Her work done, Mary Poppins takes to the air with a fond farewell from Bert , telling her not to stay away too long.',\n",

As a result, her dreams of a college education are ruined. She struggles to get educated further. Mr. Robert Brown , who is now at the helm of affairs of his father's business, agrees to continue her sponsorship. Bob is a bachelor and Mary falls in love with Bob. She learns that love comes when you least expect it in this romantic drama. A new patron comes to her aid, but love threatens to get in the way of Mary's education. Anokha Rishta, perfectly harmonizing with its title, is the story of an unusual relationship between Mary  and Robert Brown . Teenager Mary is an orphan and lives in an orphanage run by nuns. Her education had been sponsored by Robert’s father in his lifetime. After the demise of his father, when Robert takes independent charge of the family business, he comes to know of this sponsorship. Being benevolent by nature, he decides to continue it in his father’s name itself. Mary has never met her sponsor and she even does not know him by name. For her, the identity of her sponsor is ’uncle’ only to whom she regularly writes letters and her uncle  always responds to them. A youth  loves her but she ignores his advances because of his image of an irresponsible and loafer boy. On the other hand, Robert has always been in love with Dr. Pramila  but due to following different religious faiths and their parents not allowing them to marry someone from a different religion, they could not marry. However being mature and true lovers, they chose not to marry somebody else too and decided to remain bachelors only.

Xi and his tribe of San/Bushmen relatives are living well off the land in the Kalahari Desert. They are happy because the gods have provided plenty of everything, and no one in the tribe has unfulfilled wants. One day, a glass Coca-Cola bottle is thrown out of an aeroplane and falls to earth unbroken. Initially, this strange artifact seems to be another boon from the gods—-Xi\\'s people find many uses for it. But unlike anything that they have had before, there is only one bottle to go around. This exposes the tribe to a hitherto unknown phenomenon, property, and they soon find themselves experiencing things they never had before: jealousy, envy, anger, hatred, even violence. Since it has caused the tribe unhappiness on two occasions, Xi decides that the bottle is an evil thing and must be thrown off of the edge of the world. He sets out alone on his quest and encounters Western civilization for the first time. The film presents an interpretation of civilization as viewed through Xi\\'s perceptions. There are also plot lines about shy biologist Andrew Steyn who is studying the local animals ; the newly hired village school teacher, a former newspaper reporter named Kate Thompson; and some guerrillas led by Sam Boga, who are being pursued by government troops after an unsuccessful attempt to massacre the Cabinet of \"Barani\" and the president.

Also part of the chaos is an impudent safari tour guide named Jack Hind, who has designs on Thompson and often steals Steyn\\'s thunder. Xi happens upon a farm and, being hungry as well as oblivious to the concept of ownership, shoots a goat with a tranquilizer arrow. For this he is arrested and jailed for stealing livestock. M\\'pudi, who lived with the Bushmen for a long time and speaks Xi\\'s language, realizes that Xi will die in the alien environment of a prison cell, and he and Steyn manage to hire Xi as a tracker for the 11 remaining weeks of his prison sentence. Meanwhile, the guerrillas invade the school where Kate teaches and use her and her pupils as human shields for their escape by foot to the neighboring country and threaten to kill the children if they see one soldier. Steyn, M\\'pudi and Xi, who are unwittingly observing the local wildlife within the terrorists\\' chosen path, manage to immobilize the guerrillas as they are passing by and save Kate and the children. Steyn allows Xi to leave to continue his quest to the edge of the world, and subsequently he and Kate become romantically involved. Xi eventually finds himself at the top of a cliff with a solid layer of low-lying clouds obscuring the landscape below. This convinces Xi that he has reached the edge of the world, and he throws the bottle off the cliff (this scene was filmed at God\\'s Window in Eastern Transvaal, South Africa . Xi then returns to his band and a warm welcome from his family.',\n",

They flee from the ship, but are apprehended by dock workers and the New York police. The McRuby's Ukrainian crew watches the detention with some amusement, but the ship's captain and his first mate, Ion Plesin, are displeased, aware that the illegal immigrants will cost the shipping company hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines. In response, company representative Andreas Vlachos arrives to oversee future operations and warn that the crew will be liable for any more such fines. Later, the McRuby is docked in Ghana, where dock worker Kingsley Ofosu plans to some day stow away aboard a cargo ship to pursue a better life for himself and his pregnant wife in the United States. Upon winning a lottery, he decides that the time is right, as he can use the money to get on his feet upon his arrival. Ofosu, his brother and six other men slip aboard the McRuby and hide in its cargo holds. With the ship behind schedule, Plesin has only one hour to conduct a stowaway search prior to departure. The hasty endeavor fails to turn up Ofosu's group and the ship sails, bound for France, prior to sailing on to New York. Ofosu's group encounters another stowaway, who had boarded the ship in Cameroon. The men jovially discuss the vocations they intend to pursue in the United States. Later, their water container breaks, forcing them to leave the cargo area to forage for food and water. They leave evidence of the presence, which is then discovered by the crew. To prevent Vlachos from learning that the stowaway search had been incomplete, the captain has Plesin assemble a small team to conduct a secret perquisition. The stowaways are found and Plesin discusses the predicament with the captain. Given the illegal immigrant fines, they cannot bring the stowaways into port. However, they also cannot alter course to drop the men off somewhere, as Vlachos would then find out about them. The Africans are taken to be hidden within the ship's anchor hold. When they object, they find Plesin unsympathetic to their desire to escape poverty. He points out that if the stowaways' presence becomes known, he and his men will be fired, and any other jobs they can find in Ukraine will pay even less than the meager wages earned by Ofosu on the docks in Ghana. The stowaways are forced into the hold and initially left without food or water. Yuri, one of Plesin's men, takes pity and secretly delivers them a little water, but he is powerless to do more. As the stowaways suffer, Ofosu laments that he has led the group to their deaths. The captain finally acquiesces to Plesin's plan to kill the stowaways. The men are taken from the hold in small groups. As each group is brought into another area, they are ambushed and their bodies thrown overboard. Yuri tries to stop the massacre, but the others overpower and subdue him. Ofosu and his brother are the last two brought out, but they surmise what is about to occur and make a run for it, heading in different directions. As they do, Ofosu's brother is shot and, with his injury, is soon caught and thrown overboard as Ofosu watches. Ofosu flees back below decks to hide and is able to elude further searches for him. While in the cargo hold, Ofosu stashes a picture of himself and his wife inside one of the cocoa sacks. Plesin's men are concerned about their inability to locate their final stowaway, but they reason that all Western countries despise black immigrants and thus no one will be motivated to take action against them. They also expect to be able to secure him upon reaching port when he tries to exit the ship. However, once the ship docks, Ofosu is able to escape to shore and make it to the police before Plesin's men can catch him. The next day, French authorities board the McRuby to investigate Ofosu's story. Plesin first denies that there had been any stowaway, but the ship's cocoa sacks are searched, yielding Ofosu's picture. Plesin's final play is to acknowledge the killings but to suggest that he and his men had done France a favor by preventing undesirable blacks from entering the country illegally. The police are unimpressed by this rationale and immediately arrest Plesin and his men, along with the captain. The film ends with Ofosu on the phone with his wife, hearing the cries of his newborn son, whom he pledges to name after his brother. An epilogue notes that the captain and first mate were convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Three other crew members were also convicted and received 20-year sentences, while one crew member was acquitted. Kingsley Ofosu was living in France and hoping to have his wife and child join him.\",\n",

       "  'Arthur Kirkland  is a hotheaded but idealistic young defense attorney in Baltimore. As the film opens, he is in jail on a charge of contempt of court for having thrown a punch at judge Henry T. Fleming  while arguing the case of an innocent defendant, Jeff McCullaugh . McCullaugh was stopped for a minor traffic offense, but then mistaken for a killer of the same name and convicted. He has already endured year and a half in jail, as Kirkland continues his efforts to have the case reviewed against Fleming\\'s resistance. Though there is strong new evidence that the convicted man was innocent, Judge Fleming refused Kirkland\\'s appeal due to a minor technicality and leaves McCullaugh in prison. Kirkland takes another case, that of meek, gentle transgender Ralph Agee , who is guilty of a small crime and becomes a victim of the legal system. Kirkland also pays regular nursing home visits to his beloved Grandfather Sam , who is becoming senile. It is revealed that Arthur was abandoned by his parents at a young age and it was Sam who raised him and put him through law school. Arthur also begins a romance with a legal ethics committee member, Gail Packer . One day, Kirkland is shocked to find himself requested to defend Judge Fleming, who to everyone\\'s surprise has been accused of rape. The two loathe each other, but Fleming feels everyone will believe he is innocent if the person publicly known to hate him also argues his innocence. Fleming uses blackmail, telling Kirkland an old violation of lawyer-client confidentiality will be reviewed by the ethics committee and Arthur likely will be disbarred if he refuses to represent Fleming. Gail confirms this off the record. An eccentric judge named Rayford , who has a friendly relationship with Kirkland, takes him for a hair-raising ride in his personal Bell 47 helicopter over the harbor and Fort McHenry, laughing as he tests how far they can possibly go without running out of fuel, while Arthur, his terrified passenger, begs him to land the helicopter immediately. Rayford, a veteran of the Korean War, is possibly suicidal, and keeps a rifle in his chambers at the courthouse, a 1911 pistol in his shoulder holster at all times and eats his lunch out on the ledge outside his window, four stories up. Kirkland\\'s friend and partner, Jay Porter , is also unstable. He feels guilt from gaining acquittals for defendants who were truly guilty of violent crimes and goes berserk when one commits another murder. After a breakdown at the courthouse, Jay is taken to a hospital accompanied by Kirkland. Before leaving in the ambulance, a distracted Arthur calls on another lawyer friend, Warren Fresnell , to handle Ralph\\'s court hearing in his absence. Arthur gives Warren a corrected version of Ralph\\'s probation report, and stresses the fact that Warren must show the corrections to the judge so that Ralph will get probation rather than being sent to jail. Unfortunately, Warren forgets to appear on time, fails to show the judge the corrected report, and Ralph is sentenced to jail where he commits suicide through hanging off-screen. Kirkland is livid, and attacks Warren\\'s car with his briefcase in retaliation and to get his attention. Warren argues that Ralph\\'s trial was nothing but \"nickels and dimes\" and beneath him, before Kirkland sternly reminds him \"they\\'re people\" and then informing of Ralph\\'s suicide . His other client, McCullaugh, abused by fellow prisoners , snaps one day and takes two hostages. Arthur pleads with him to surrender, promising to get him out, but the police shoot and kill McCullaugh after he stands up, providing a shot for a police sharpshooter, as Arthur looks on in horror. A clearly disturbed Kirkland takes on Judge Fleming\\'s case, which Judge Rayford and a jury will hear in court. Arthur acquires evidence from another client, Carl, incriminating photographs that show Fleming in BDSM acts with a prostitute. Gail warns him not to betray a client. He shows the pictures to Fleming, who then freely admits that he is guilty of the rape. Disgusted with his situation, Kirkland goes to trial. Fleming makes a sleazy remark to Kirkland about wanting to rape the victim again, which finally pushes Kirkland to the breaking point. In his opening statement, Arthur begins by mocking the case of the prosecuting attorney  while speaking of the ultimate objective of the American legal system. He appears to be making a strong case to exonerate Fleming. But unexpectedly, he bursts out and says that prosecution is not going to get Fleming, because he is going to get him. Kirkland tells the jury, \"My client, The Honorable Henry T. Fleming, should go right to fucking jail! The son of a bitch is guilty!\" The courtroom erupts and the presiding judge Rayford, the prosecution, and the others in the court room are enraged and flabbergasted at the turn of events, including Gail. The judge calls Kirkland \"out of order,\" bangs his gavel to bring the court to order. Arthur replies, \"You\\'re out of order! You\\'re out of order! The whole trial\\'s out of order!\" Arthur is dragged away, continuing to shout his rage all the way out the door and to criticize Fleming for his and the legal system\\'s abuse of law and order that cost the lives of his two clients and let true criminals like Fleming go free to commit more crimes. As the courtroom spectators cheer for Arthur, Fleming sits down in defeat, and a fed-up Rayford walks out of his stand. In the end, Kirkland sits on the court\\'s steps, all by himself, weary from his breakdown but satisfied, knowing his antics probably cost him his practice and career in law, but will presumably finally put Fleming in jail. His partner Jay, just released from the mental hospital, climbs up the long steps, tipping his toupee like a hat and greets him with a friendly \"Hi, Arthur\" and walks away and inside the court building.',\n",

Charlot becomes annoyed with Gertie\\'s efforts to stand out, literally, from the chorus. He threatens to fire her, but stage manager Jack Roper intercedes and gets her hired as a general understudy to the leads.

       "  \"Twin zoologists Oswald and Oliver Deuce  are at work studying the behavior of animals at a zoo, when their wives are killed in a car accident involving a large swan. The woman who was driving the car, Alba Bewick , is not killed, but she sustains enough damage to warrant the amputation of a leg. Venus de Milo , a woman associated with the zoo, attempts to forge a relationship with the twins, ostensibly to help them recover from their loss. Meanwhile, Oswald and Oliver gradually become obsessed with images of growth and decay, watching videos on the origins of life and creating time-lapse video of decomposing life forms. They begin this latter task with a green apple, bitten into and rotting before their camera lens. The twins' descent sees them become romantically involved with Alba, and increasingly attached to one another. Venus de Milo remains involved with them enough to observe their obsessions grow: they take to video-taping the decomposition of prawns, and they take a personal interest in Alba's childhood, going so far as to ask her to show them a field seen in a photograph on her bedside table. They become obsessed with snails, and they take advantage of their contacts at the zoo to create decomposition videos of more and more complex animals, moving gradually up the food chain.  Alba becomes a subject for the experiments of her surgeon, who eventually amputates her other leg, claiming it is putting stress on her spine. His true motive is to fashion Alba into a subject of his recreations of Johannes Vermeer paintings; Venus de Milo participates in this process, as well. Ultimately, the Deuce brothers' obsession with decay leads them to the top of the food chain, and to a complex life-and-death negotiation with Alba herself. The brothers' project seems the only possible emotional investment for either of them, so Alba offers herself as the final specimen to be photographed in its decay. However, her family intervenes before the brothers can claim her, so they are forced to find another way to create their final time-lapse video. They do so by returning to the field of Alba's childhood and setting up the necessary equipment to facilitate and capture their own decomposition.\",\n",

Tom then sops up the last bit of fish gravy with his finger, but Jerry eats it and also takes the skin off that finger.

       "  ' Truck driver Martin \"Rubber Duck\" Penwald is driving through the desert in Arizona, when a woman in a Jaguar E-Type passes by. They\\'re driving side by side for a while when a sheriff\\'s deputy pulls over Rubber Duck, who in turn sets the deputy upon the woman who was \"enticing him\". Proceeding on his way, Rubber Duck runs into fellow truck drivers Pig Pen/Love Machine and Spider Mike, when another \"trucker\" informs them over the C.B. that they are okay to increase their speed. The \"trucker\" also insults Pig Pen by calling his Mack truck a \"pussy.\" As they come around a sharp turn at 75 mph, they are caught by the \"trucker,\" corrupt county Sheriff \"Dirty Lyle\" Wallace. After being extorted by Lyle for $50 dollars each and eventually $70 when both Pig Pen and Mike insult Wallace, the Duck informs Wallace that The Teamsters are organizing the cops to which Lyle responds that he wants no part of the Duck\\'s damn union. The Duck reminds Wallace that he is independent and Lyle comments that they have that in common to which The Duck answers back that there also not many of them  left. Duck, Pig Pen and Mike leave and head on to Rafael\\'s Glide-In where The Duck\\'s sometime girlfriend, Violet, works as a waitress. Also there is Melissa, the driver of the Jaguar. Her car had broken down and is there for repairs and she is selling Widow Woman some of her things so she can have money to leave Arizona. The Duck arrives and reunites with Violet and meets Melissa face to face, Melissa informs Violet that she knows The Duck because he was the one who told the cop she was nude driving. The Duck asks Melissa if she has ever ridden in a truck and she says no, but is intrigued by him and might take him on his offer to ride in his truck. Violet then ushers him away to give him a special birthday present. While away Wallace shows up at the Glide-In checking plates. Pig Pen and Spider Mike start making fun of Wallace as he drives around the truck stop, but when the waitress makes some noise in the background collecting dirty plates, Wallace finds where they are and enters the diner and asks Pig Pen how much money he has and he shows Wallace his roll of bills. When Spider Mike informs Wallace that he has no money, Wallace attempts to arrest him. The Duck enters  and tries to break things up and smooth things over. But Lyle is determined and Mike informs him that he has to get home because his wife is due to give birth. Lyle insults Mike by asking who the father is and pushes Mike and Mike punches Wallace. Lyle reaches for his gun and Duck kicks Lyle, knocking him out. Pig Pen informs him \"well you blew Arizona...\" knowing they will get arrested if they stay Duck orders everyone to their trucks and begins to handcuff Wallace, at that moment two other sheriff officers come in . A fight soon breaks out involving The Duck, Pig Pen, Mike, Widow Woman and a couple of other truckers. The truckers prevail and The Duck handcuffs Wallace to a bar stool. After pulling the spark plug wires and distributor caps out of the police cars, they all decide to head for the state line to avoid prosecution. The truckers drive across Arizona and New Mexico, with Wallace in belated pursuit. While on the run, Widow Woman\\'s truck rolls over, so she hops in another truck. The initial police pursuit is foiled when Duck leads the truckers off the main highway and down a desert trail, causing several of the police cars to crash. Wallace commandeers the vehicle of one of the state troopers, but is also thwarted when Pig Pen and Spider Mike crush his vehicle between their rigs wilst in motion. Wallace orders that the local state police set up a roadblock, but Rubber Duck tells the police that the contents of the tanker he is pulling are explosive. Upon hearing this, the police clear the road block and let the convoy proceed undeterred. Additional independent truckers join them to form a mile-long convoy in support of the Rubber Duck\\'s vendetta against the abusive Wallace. The truckers communicate with each other via CB Radio, and much CB jargon is sprinkled throughout the film. As the rebellious truckers evade and confront the police, Rubber Duck becomes a reluctant folk hero. It becomes apparent the truckers have a great deal of political support and the Governor of New Mexico, Jerry Haskins, meets Rubber Duck. At about the same time, Wallace and a brutal Alvarez, Texas sheriff, arrest Spider Mike, who left the convoy to be with his wife after giving birth to their son. Wallace\\'s plan is to trap Rubber Duck. A janitor at the jail, unaware of the plan, messages by CB radio that Spider Mike has been arrested and beaten. Various truckers relay the message to New Mexico. Rubber Duck ends the meeting with Haskins and leaves to rescue Spider Mike. Several other truckers join him and head east to Texas. The truckers eventually destroy the jail and rescue Spider Mike. Knowing they will now be hunted by the authorities, the truckers head for the border of Mexico. On the way, Rubber Duck gets separated from the rest of the convoy when the others get stopped by a traffic accident. The film culminates with a showdown near the United States-Mexico border where Rubber Duck is forced to face Wallace and a National Guard unit stationed on a bridge. Firing an M60 machine gun on top of an M42 Duster, Wallace and the Guardsmen destroy the truck causing it to plummet from the bridge and crash into the churning river. The film concludes with a public funeral for Rubber Duck, in which Haskins promises to work for the truckers by taking their case to Washington, D.C. Disgusted with the politics of the situation, Pig Pen abruptly leaves the funeral. A distraught Melissa is led to a school bus with several \"long-haired friends of Jesus\" inside. There she finds Rubber Duck in disguise sitting in the back. He asks, \"You ever seen a duck that couldn\\'t swim?\" The convoy takes to the road with the coffin in tow, abruptly ending the politicians\\' speeches. As the bus passes Wallace, he spies the Duck and bursts into laughter.',\n",
       "  'Sea Org officer Ronnie Miscavige describes the planetary Scientology dissemination campaign. After the title sequence, Scientologist Diane Wheat  is seen in an auditing session with the head of her local church, Robert Solomon . Diane describes her trouble with finances and having her car repossessed. The next day Robert has Diane model her financial difficulties in clay. She is worried that her other financial obligations keep her from moving up Scientology\\'s Bridge to Total Freedom. Robert tells her that she can work at the church in exchange for services to move up the Bridge. Parallel to these events, Richard Grey  is trying to contact his daughter Amy at the Flag Land Base in Clearwater. Church employees refuse to allow him to speak to her because, unbeknownst to him, he has been declared a suppressive person. He arrives at the local church on Saturday seeking more information. Diane, who is working as a receptionist, hands him a copy of the ethics order declaring him a suppressive person, and he leaves. The next day, Diane is working at the church again when two teenage girls arrive. The girls have seen the South Park episode \"Trapped in the Closet\" and want to attend a service for their own amusement. Diane tells them that the church does not have Sunday services, and shows them a promotional film for Dianetics instead. At home, Richard is reading the Operation Clambake and Lermanet.com web sites when he receives a panicked instant message from a friend. The friend tells him to watch a news report from Clearwater, and he learns that Amy has died after falling from the Fort Harrison Hotel. Shortly afterward, Robert calls Richard and informs him that he may not attend the funeral because Amy and her mother have disconnected from him. At a celebration of L. Ron Hubbard\\'s birthday, Robert announces that Diane has attained the state of Clear and gives her a Clear bracelet. After the celebration, he takes the bracelet away  and shows her a film that encourages her to continue on the Bridge by taking the Operating Thetan courses at Flag. Late in the night, while she is cleaning, a distraught Richard comes by and asks if he can talk to anyone about being allowed into the funeral service. She refuses, but Richard insists on dropping off some old Scientology books and tapes that used to belong to Amy. Diane listens to one of Amy\\'s cassettes from the high–level Clearwater Scientology center and hears a man\\'s voice speaking scoldingly about being \"willing to talk to the auditor\", in an impenetrable jargon laden with nonsense words. In the final act, protesters are seen outside the church loudly picketing over the death of Amy. When Diane walks out to confront them, they ask her to step outside the church gate and proceed to tell her the story of Xenu and the Wall of Fire from Operating Thetan level 3 . Robert notices Diane outside the church, tells her to go back inside, and threatens the protesters, but not before they have finished telling her the story. Once Diane is back inside, Robert runs her on a security check to determine whether she has any doubts or ill will toward Scientology. Richard calls Amy\\'s mother, who is still in Scientology and asks to be allowed at the funeral. She refuses and ends the call to avoid being sent to ethics. In the evening, Robert reminds Diane of the need to continue up the Bridge, and mentions the Wall of Fire at OT III. That night, disillusioned after returning to a room which earlier she was prevented from entering  and discovering it is merely a closet, Diane walks out the door of the church and leaves Scientology. The film ends with a written dedication: \"For all who speak out — for those who have been silenced.\"',\n",

SpongeBob, Patrick and Squidward are told by the young surfers that the only way to get back to Bikini Bottom is to surf there; unfortunately they do not know how to.

       "  'The film opens with a woman walking her dog down an empty, darkened city street. As she passes by a manhole, she is attacked by a creature, and the dog is pulled in after her. George Cooper ([[John Heard  lives with his girlfriend Lauren . George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City\\'s homeless population, specifically those known as \"undergrounders\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch  is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons  being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \"The Reverend\" Shepherd ([[Daniel Stern , who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch\\'s superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson , who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but radioactive, chemical toxic waste has mutated them into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed. Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved , and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and an unexpected visitor that comes up through the sewer access point that she unfortunately decides to open in the basement of her apartment building. Then, through the dangerous investigative efforts of both A.J. and George, the absolute horror is revealed: The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is directly involved in the slaughter that has been going on. Although the political bureaucracy has forbidden the NRC to transport the toxic wastes through New York because of the large-scale danger to the public, it has secretly been hiding the waste by-products beneath Manhattan in abandoned subway tunnels. Unfortunately, the underground homeless population has been coming into contact with these by-products, turning them into the mutated creatures. It is this secret that Wilson guards to the extent of having a mysterious and threatening lackey disrupt A.J. from making phone calls to the press. This thug then locks A.J. in an underground access tunnel either to suffocate from the gas to be used to asphyxiate the C.H.U.D.s, or to leave him to become their prey. Wilson is clearly willing to kill to protect his employer\\'s secrets—even a cop. Later that evening at a diner, two police officers enter and while the waitress and the two are discussing, the monsters return and attack the diner inhabitants Captain Bosch argues with Wilson over how to deal with the threat: Wilson wants to seal the sewers, open up some gas lines, and asphyxiate the C.H.U.D.s despite the inherent danger to the city. Wilson, after being overwhelmed by Bosch decides to shoot him and activates the truck in reverse in order to stop George and AJ but they escape from the manhole just in time as Wilson pass them over. AJ finds Bosch\\'s gun and shoots and kills Wilson before he runs over them, then the truck explodes as it falls on the manhole, Bosch is still alive and George, Lauren, and AJ are saved.',\n",
       "  'The film begins with a voice over explaining the \"cause\" of the filmmakers in attempting to expose a \"crual custom\" that exists in the rural areas of the Punjab where women are married off  to the Quran so that the landowning family doesn\\'t have to part with any of its wealth. The action is based around the rural haveli of Vadda Saeen - the family elder, and his wife. They live in their sprawling estate together with the extended family that is usually warring with one another. There are also legions of slaves  who devote themselves to the Vadda Saeen and show their love for their Saeen by kissing and nuzzling his feet! The house contains two warring \"bahu\\'s\", the benign, kindhearted widow Naghma and the Wicked-Super-Dyke-from-Hell Bahar. Naghma has a demented son, Babar Ali who shoots people for fun and a daughter, Saima, an overgrown 35-year-old teenager with an unhealthy pigeon fetish. Problems arise when it is discovered that the family will stand to lose a large segment of their land once Saima is wedded. The family elders, cajoled and abetted by Eyebrow Queen Bahar decide to adopt a plan where Saima is to get married, not to a handsome young prince but to the Holy Book. There are to be no festivities, no joy and little chance of children. Not only that, but she is to wear only white and must live with her husband in a deserted mausoleum! Naturally Saima, expecting marriage to a handsome young pigeon is rather depressed when she is banished to a life on the periphery. Matters start coming to a head when Rana returns from \"frontline duty\" to find that the girl of his dreams has been forced to wed the Quran and live in exile. He consults a nearby imam who tells him that such marriages are unrecognized by Islam and are simply an illegal schemes by which families attempt to retain their wealth. So, armed with this information, the hitherto timid Rana decides to take on the almighty family of Vadda Saeen, led by the dangerously psychotic Babar Ali. First off, the movie must be commended for at least making an attempt to tackle a relevant issue in a language most likely to be understood by the masses. The film is also to be commended for avoiding the sleazy element associated with Punjabi movies. Syed Noor plays to the masses but avoids the smutty element quite successfully going for the wholesome style of \"Choorian\" instead. The film has some fairly decent tunes to help it along, but the pace starts slowing more and more as we approach the inevitable climax. Saima looks fetching and should be featuring in next years Film Award ceremonies for her acting in this film - yet she looks considerably older than her co-star Moammar Rana. Bahar eats up the screen and dominates as only she can while Nirma, as Babar Ali\\'s trinket doesn\\'t make much impression despite being given a sizzling number to perform. Nirma\\'s future doesn\\'t appear to be too bright. Babar Ali ends up taking most of the acting accolades delivering a menacing performance as the evil brother Mattoo. He ought to forget about taking on romantic leads considering how average  he looks and would be far better advised to stick to this sort of negative role, which he performed with such distinction here. Mehndi Waley Hath is at least not an outright embarrassment and is somewhat elevated by the \"message\" that it attempts to deliver. A feather in director/producer/screenwriter Syed Noor\\'s cap - a rare commodity these days.',\n",

To the citizens and former pupils of Liberty Hill, she is regarded as the epitome of gentility and wisdom. As the film begins, Miss Dove leaves her home on a typical day, her habits never varying. She oils her creaking gate and resumes her walk to the schoolhouse, briefly stopping to address her neighbors along the way. As the school bell rings, she stands at the entrance to her classroom as each of her pupils line up and greet her with \"Good morning, Miss Dove.\" During this morning\\'s session, she reprimands David Burnham for swearing and tells him that he must remain after class and write \"Nothing is achieved by swearing\" twenty times in his notebook. During David\\'s internment, Miss Dove suddenly feels a sharp pain at the base of her spine and tells David to run and tell his father that she is ill. After David leaves, Miss Dove puts her head down on her desk and begins to think about the day when her father died and changed her life forever. She had met a promising new beau and was telling her father about him when her father suddenly died. After his death, she learns that her father, who was President of the local bank, \"borrowed\" a large sum of money and their home was heavily mortgaged. Miss Dove is determined to make the matter right and instructs Mr. Porter, the new bank president, that she will repay the debt by becoming a teacher. Mr. Pendleton visits Miss Dove and proposes marriage but she turns him down after she receives a call from Mr. Porter telling her that he has obtained a position for her at Cedar Grove School. Miss Dove returns to the present when Dr. Baker and Rev. Burnham arrive and form a seat with their arms to carry her through the streets of Liberty Hill to the hospital. She is admitted to her room by a former student, Billie Jean, who chatters incessantly along the way. Billie Jean, who left Liberty Hill and had a child out of wedlock, has returned to her hometown and is smitten with a police officer named Bill Holloway . Miss Dove fondly recalls Bill and tells Billie Jean that he was one of her best pupils. In a flashback, she tells how he arrived to her classroom, a poor, ill-kempt boy with a bad reputation. Over the years, Miss Dove gave Bill odd jobs and even bought him a suit for his high school graduation. As Bill entered the Marines, he wrote to Miss Dove often, and when he returned to Liberty Hill, she was the first person he came to for advice about his future career. The news of Miss Dove\\'s hospitalization spreads and she is soon visited by her former students. Another flashback shows Maurice Levine when he came to Cedar Grove as a Jewish boy unable to speak English and was teased by his classmates. Miss Dove taught him to speak English and teaches her students the importance of respect toward all people. He becomes a successful playwright and Miss Dove even travels to New York to see his first play. Another visitor is Frederick Makepeace, who is doing time at the local jail for petty theft. Dr. Baker\\'s wife, Virginia  recalls how Miss Dove offered her solace and direction after a failed engagement. Dr. Baker informs Miss Dove that she must have surgery to remove a growth on her spine. Mr. Porter offers to get Miss Dove a skilled surgeon but she insists that Dr. Baker perform the surgery. On the day of the surgery, classes are dismissed and the townspeople wait outside the hospital for news of Miss Dove\\'s operation. As she awakes, Dr. Baker tells her that the operation has been a success and that she will be all right. As the bells begin to ring throughout the town, Billie Jean tells Miss Dove that school was dismissed. In typical fashion, Miss Dove tells Dr. Baker that he must inform Mr. Spivey, the principal of the school, that the children must be returned to their classes in order to study for the state proficiency exams the following week.',\n",

He has plans to acquire a whole train of smuggled fuel, which he finds at cut-price. To obtain a loan that would subsidize the heist, he visits Grga Pitić, a wheelchair-using old gangster, who's an old friend of Zarije Destanov, Matko's father and Zare's grandfather. Matko then plots the details of the job with an ally named Dadan, a rich, fun-living, drug-snorting gangster who has a harem, juggles grenades, and cheats at gambling. However, Dadan double-crosses him and glitches up the deal by giving Matko a drink that is drugged, and carrying out the job while Matko is unconscious, which means that Matko owes Dadan a great deal of cash. Matko cannot afford to pay, so Dadan makes a deal whereby he would forgive the debt, thereby wiping the slate clean, if Zare and Afrodita, Dadan's midget sister whom he desperately wants to marry off, get married. However, Zare is in love with Ida, a barmaid who works in an establishment run by her Roma grandmother Sujka, and Afrodita is waiting for the man of her dreams. Dadan coerces Afrodita into marrying by dunking her in a well, while Zare first learns of the scheme to marry him off from Ida, who has overheard Dadan and Matko plotting it in the restaurant where she works. Meanwhile, Zare retrieves Zarije from the hospital where he is being kept, with the aid of a gypsy band. Grga Pitić is having problems of his own, as he wants his grandsons, including six-foot plus giant Grga Veliki, to get married. The two reluctantly endure the wedding ceremony held at Matko's house, which Dadan refuses to postpone after the sudden apparent death of Zarije. They were not supposed to have a wedding while in mourning, but Dadan decides to delay the death announcement, so Matko and Zare hide Zarije's body in the attic, packed in ice. Zare is dismayed, since he wants to leave the place, and had hoped that the required mourning period for his beloved grandfather would give him the opportunity to get away, and thus avoid being married off against his will. Ida and Sujka provide the catering for the wedding, and Ida is upset at seeing her beloved married off to someone else. By contrast, Dadan is really enjoying himself, whether dancing to gypsy band music, bouncing on the bed with his harem, and juggling grenades. However, the bride runs away mid-ceremony, pursued by Dadan, Matko and Dadan's criminal cronies. Meanwhile, Grga Veliki is driving his father and brother to Matko's house so that they may visit Zarije's grave . The fleeing bride then stumbles across Grga Veliki, and he stops the truck when he sees her crossing the road; he is willing to protect her from her villainous brother, and the couple fall instantly in love. Grga Pitić arrives on the scene, after his wheelchair had fallen out the back of the truck and rolled downhill, and he is delighted that Grga Veliki has found his mate. The old gangster forces Dadan, who had once worked for him, to accept the match. The groom meanwhile conspires with Sujka and Ida to bring Dadan down a peg, and rigs the outhouse so that the seat will come apart. While the preparations for the wedding ceremony of Afrodita and Grga Veliki are being conducted, Matko and Dadan pass the time by playing dice, with Dadan cheating. Sujka comes in during the game, and serves the unsuspecting Dadan a drink spiked with something that would give him diarrhea. Furthermore, Grga Pitić apparently dies, and Dadan and Matko hide his body in the attic, where Zarije's body is also hidden. However, the two corpses soon both come back to life; they were not dead after all. They are surprised to find themselves together, as they had not seen each other for 25 years and each had thought the other was dead. During the ceremony, Dadan starts to feel uncomfortable and rushes into the outhouse ... and falls into the manure. His harem and cronies desert him, and as he tries to clean himself off on a goose, only Matko remains loyal, and he provides Dadan with a shower from the garden hose. Zare meanwhile grabs the wedding official at gunpoint and orders him to solemnize his marriage with his sweetheart, Ida, and the two sail off together on a riverboat set for Bulgaria with a fistful of cash stashed in his grandfather's accordion, the blessing of their respective grandparents and, as witnesses, a black cat and a white cat.\",\n",

       "  \"Charles Farmer is a former astronaut-in-training who was discharged from the military before he could fulfill his dream of becoming a vital part of NASA. Having missed the opportunity to travel into space, he decides to build a replica of the historic Mercury-Atlas in the barn on his secluded ranch in the fictional town of Story, Texas, using all his assets and facing foreclosure as a result. When he begins making inquiries about purchasing rocket fuel, the FBI and FAA step in to investigate, and the ensuing publicity thrusts Farmer into the spotlight and makes him a media darling. Farmer's first launch is delayed by endless red tape created by government officials, who seek to stall him beyond his deadline to foreclose on the farm.

       "  'David Sumner , a timid American mathematician, leaves the chaos of college anti-war protests to live with his young wife, Amy ([[Susan George , in her hometown of Wakely, a fictional village in Cornwall, England. Almost immediately, there is tension between the couple as David becomes immersed in his academic work and differing ideas regarding the nature of their relationship come to light: David wants the traditional division of tasks, with the man earning wages, and the wife satisfying his needs in the kitchen and bed. Amy wants greater participation from David if she is going to accept such a role: she wants him to perform all the traditionally male tasks, like fixing the toaster, but also to involve himself in her community. Chris Cawsey ([[Jim Norton , Norman Scutt , Riddaway , and Amy\\'s former lover, Charlie Venner , are Wakely locals hired to renovate the Sumners\\' isolated farmhouse. They openly resent David for his intellectual pursuits, and persistently harass him. When Amy discovers their cat strangled and hanging by a light chain in their bedroom closet, Amy claims the workmen did it to intimidate David. She presses him to confront the villagers, but he refuses. David tries to win their friendship, and they invite him to go hunting in the woods the next day. During the trip, David is taken to a remote forest meadow and left there, after the workmen promise to drive the birds towards him. Having ditched David, Venner returns to the couple\\'s farmhouse where he rapes Amy. Scutt arrives, forces Venner to hold Amy down, and rapes Amy as well. After several hours, David realizes he\\'s been tricked and returns home to find a disheveled and withdrawn Amy. She does not tell him about the rapes. The next day, David fires the workmen, claiming that they have performed poorly and wasted time. Later that week, the Sumners attend a church social where Amy becomes distraught after seeing the men who raped her. They leave the social early, and, while driving home through thick fog, accidentally hit the local village idiot Henry Niles ([[David Warner , whom they take to their home. David phones the local pub about the accident. However, earlier that evening Niles had accidentally strangled a flirtatious young girl from the village, Janice Hedden , and now her father, the town drunkard, Tom , and the workmen looking for him are alerted by the phone call to Niles\\'s whereabouts. Soon the drunken locals, including Amy\\'s rapists, are pounding on the door of the Sumners\\' home. After a few minutes of their breaking the windows and hammering on the door, the local magistrate, Major John Scott , arrives and after attempting to defuse the situation, is shot dead by Tom. At this point the father and the workmen agree that they cannot go back on what they have done, but only continue. David realizes that they will not allow anyone in the house to live and begins preparing to defend his home. First he heats two saucepans of cooking oil. Then, when one of the locals attempts to enter through the window, he ties his hands together at knifepoint. As more men appear at another window, he scalds them with the boiling oil, temporarily incapacitating them. Then he lays down a large mantrap in his living room and sends Amy upstairs to hide. When Tom and Cawsey enter and attempt to shoot David, he knocks the shotgun out of Tom\\'s hands, causing it to fire and mangle the man\\'s foot, mortally wounding him. He then engages in a fight with Cawsey, beating him to death with a fire poker. Finally, Charlie appears and holds David at gunpoint, but before he can shoot him, the two hear Amy screaming. As they both run upstairs, the fifth man, Scutt, is there. He tells Charlie to take David downstairs and kill him, so they can rape Amy again. Instead, Charlie shoots Scutt and David begins to fight Charlie. As they reach the living room, David, despite Amy\\'s pleas not to, kills Charlie by springing the mantrap over his head, crushing his neck. As David looks at the carnage around him, he murmurs, \"Jesus, I got \\'em all.\" He is then attacked by another villager and, losing the struggle, asks Amy to fetch the shotgun and shoot him. Amy hesitates before retrieving the weapon and shooting the villager. David is driving Niles to town when the latter turns and says, \"I don\\'t know my way home.\" David smiles and replies, \"That\\'s okay. I don\\'t either.\"',\n",

       "  'In the not-too-distant future, androids have come into common usage. Rikuo Sakisaka, who has taken robots for granted for his entire life, one day discovers that Sammy, his home android, has been acting independently and coming and going on her own. He finds a strange phrase recorded in her activity log, \"Are you enjoying the Time of Eve?\". He, along with his friend Masakazu Masaki, traces Sammy\\'s movements and finds an unusual cafe, \"The Time of Eve\". Nagi, the barista, informs them that the cafe\\'s main rule is to not discriminate between humans and androids. Within the cafe, androids do not display their status rings, and, when patrons depart, the door is automatically locked for two minutes to prevent someone from following them to discover their true nature. The first few episodes involve conversations between Rikuo  and the cafe regulars: the bubbly Akiko, child Chie and her elderly guardian, the lovers Koji and Rina, and others. These conversations make frequent allusion to Isaac Asimov\\'s Three Laws of Robotics, often highlighting surprising interpretations of those laws, some of which form apparent loopholes. The overarching plot involves the beginnings of independence displayed by the androids, what they do with that independence within the bounds of the three laws, and what motivates them. Secondary plots involve the individual stories of each android the protagonists encounter in the cafe, and how they come to discover which patrons are androids and which are not.',\n",

       "  'The film is divided into five segments , each segment depicting a different stage in the life of a Buddhist monk. The segments are roughly ten to twenty years apart, and the action of each takes place during the season of its title.  We are introduced to the life of the very young Buddhist apprentice living with his master on a small floating monastery, drifting on a lake in the serene forested mountains of Korea. The apprentice and his master live a life of prayer and meditation, using an old rowboat to reach the bank of the lake where they regularly go walking, for exercise and to collect herbs. One day, in a creek amongst the rocky hills, the apprentice torments a fish by tying a small stone to it with string and laughing as it struggles to swim. Shortly after, he does the same to a frog and a snake; his master quietly observes on all three occasions, and that night ties a large, smooth rock to the apprentice as he sleeps. In the morning, he tells his apprentice that he cannot take off the rock until he unties the creatures he tormented - adding that if any of them have died, he will \"carry the stone in his heart forever\". The boy struggles with the load on his back through the forest, and finds the fish, lying dead at the bottom of the creek, finds the frog still alive and struggling where he left it, and finds the snake in a pool of blood, presumably attacked and killed by another animal, unable to get away. The master watches as the boy begins to cry heavily at seeing what he has done to the snake.  The apprentice  encounters a mother and daughter  walking along the forest path, looking for the lake monastery. The apprentice silently greets them and rows them across the lake to the monastery, where it is revealed that the daughter has an unspecified illness  and has been brought to the Buddhist master by her mother, hoping that she will be healed. The master agrees to take in the teenage girl for a time, and the mother leaves. Over the next few days, the apprentice finds himself sexually attracted to the girl, but is too shy to say anything; however, when he finds her sleeping in front of the Buddha statue, he is unable to resist groping her chest. She wakes up and slaps him. In a guilty panic, the apprentice begins to pray incessantly, something his master notes as strange. Touching the apprentice\\'s shoulder, the girl seems to forgive him. Eventually, the two wander off into the forest alone and have sex. They repeat the act over the next few nights, hiding their relationship from the master, until he discovers them asleep and naked, drifting around the lake in the rowboat. He wakes them up by pulling the plug out of the boat. Rather than expressing anger or disappointment, he merely warns his apprentice that \"lust leads to desire for possession, and possession leads to murder\", but does tell him that the girl will have to leave. The apprentice reacts emotionally to this, and in the middle of the night runs away from the monastery in pursuit of the girl, taking the monastery\\'s Buddha statue and a rooster with him.  Many years later, during the Fall, the aging master returns from a supply run to the local village including a cat. By chance he glimpses a warrant for the arrest of his former apprentice in a newspaper, wanted for the murder of his wife. Foreseeing the apprentice\\'s return, he modifies the teenage monk\\'s garments by hand, and soon afterward the adult apprentice appears in the spiritual door at the lake\\'s edge, still full of anger and carrying the bloodstained knife with which he stabbed his wife for having started an affair with another man. Unwilling to go on, he seals his eyes, mouth and nose in a suicide ritual and sits in front of the newly returned Buddha statue, waiting for death. The master discovers him, and beats him ruthlessly, professing that while he may have killed his wife, he will not kill himself so easily. He ties his bloodied apprentice to the ceiling and sets a candle to slowly burn through the rope, then begins painting \"Heart Sutra\" on one side of the monastery deck, by dipping his cat\\'s tail into a bowl of black ink. The apprentice eventually falls, and beginning his repentance, cuts his hair off and starts carving the Chinese characters out of the wood. As he carves and the master paints, two detectives arrive at the monastery and try to arrest the apprentice, but the master asks them to let him finish his task until the next day. The apprentice continues without stopping, and collapses into sleep immediately upon finishing. Seemingly influenced by the soothing presence of the master, the detectives help the old monk paint his apprentice\\'s carvings in orange, green, blue and purple. The apprentice finally wakes up, and is taken away by the detectives. After they leave, the master, knowing that he is at his end, builds a pyre in the rowboat. He seals his ears, eyes, nose and mouth with paper in the same suicide ritual his apprentice performed and meditates as he is suffocated and burned to death. One can see his tears in the paper seals as flames engulf him.  Paroled, the now middle-aged apprentice returns to the frozen lake and to his former home, which has been drifting uninhabited for years. He finds his master\\'s clothes, laid out just before his death, and digs his master\\'s remains, his teeth only, out of the frozen rowboat. He carves a statue of the Buddha out of ice, wraps his master\\'s \"Sarira\", in red cloth, and sets them in the statue under a waterfall. He finds a book of choreographic meditative stances, and begins to train and exercise in the freezing weather. Eventually, a woman comes to the monastery with her baby son and a shawl wrapped around her face. She leaves her son and flees into the night, but as she runs across the frozen lake she unknowingly stumbles into the hole dug by the monk. He finds her body the next day, and he removes her from the water to look at her face, although it is not shown to viewers. He ties the monastery\\'s large, circular stone to his body and retrieves another statue from the monastery before climbing to the summit of the tallest surrounding mountain. As he climbs, he reflects upon the fish, the frog, and the snake. He prays at the summit, and leaves the statue overlooking the monastery.  Finally, returning to \"Spring\", the cycle is completed: the new master lives in the monastery with the abandoned baby, now his apprentice. The boy is shown to torment a turtle and, wandering into the rocky hills, echoes his predecessor, forcing stones into the mouths of a fish, frog and snake.',\n",

He and Rosemary leave to obtain one, nearly getting caught in the darkness when the vehicle breaks down and they lose the light. Rosemary hears a baby crying in the dark, ignoring Luke\\'s warnings that it is the darkness trying to trick her, she is lured under a solitary street light, and the lamp goes out taking her with it. At the bar, James goes to get Paul some water, and the drain on the power causes the lights to flash out.

       "  'Jane Austen  is the younger daughter of Reverend George Austen  and his wife  and has yet to find a suitable husband. She wishes to be a writer, to the dismay of her mother and proud delight of her father. Thomas Lefroy  is a promising lawyer with a bad reputation, which he describes as \"typical\" for people in the profession. Tom makes a bad first impression upon meeting Jane, when he nearly falls asleep while she gives a reading of her work for the company. Overhearing his subsequent criticism, Jane cannot stand the arrogant Irishman. Meanwhile she turns down the affections of other men, including Mr. Wisley , the nephew and heir of the wealthy Lady Gresham . Wisley proposes, but Jane ultimately rejects him due to lack of affection. The mischievous Tom encounters Jane again; they argue, but increasingly take interest in each other, and Tom demonstrates that he takes Jane\\'s literary aspirations seriously. In time they fall in love. Tom, Jane, her brother Henry ([[Joe Anderson , and Jane\\'s rich widowed cousin, Eliza, Comtesse de Feullide , conspire to receive an invitation from Tom\\'s uncle and benefactor, the Lord Chief Judge Langlois of London,  for the rich \"Madame La Comtesse\" and her friends. This visit is meant to be a short break in their journey to see Jane\\'s brother, Edward. This would allow Judge Langlois to get to know Jane before and give a blessing for their marriage. Full of hope, Jane cannot sleep during the night at the Judge\\'s place. In a flow of inspiration, she then begins the writing of First Impressions, the manuscript that will become Pride and Prejudice. However, Judge Langlois receives a letter informing him of the genteel poverty of Jane\\'s family, and he refuses to give Tom his blessing, declaring that he would wish Tom to be the whoremonger he had been rather than allow him to live in poverty because of a bad marriage. Tom tells Jane that he cannot marry her, and she is crushed, not knowing that Tom has a legitimate reason; his family depends on him financially. Jane goes back home and soon learns that Tom has become engaged to someone else at the arrangement of his family. Jane accepts the marriage proposal of Mr. Wisley, whom she had earlier turned down. Later, Tom realises he cannot live without Jane, and returns, asking Jane to run away with him, for \"what value will there be in life, if we are not together?\" Jane agrees, and they leave, with only Jane\\'s sister Cassandra  knowing they plan to marry in secret. On the way, Jane stumbles upon a letter from Tom\\'s mother, and realises his situation: he sends money he receives from his uncle back to his parents and siblings, and his family cannot survive without it. She tells Tom that they cannot elope, not with so many people depending upon him. He insists that he and Jane must marry and tells her he will earn money, but Jane tells him that it will not be enough; he will never be able to make enough money to support his dependents with a High Court judge  as an enemy and with a penniless wife. Distraught, Tom asks her if she loves him, and she replies, “Yes, but if our love destroys your family, then it will destroy itself, in a long, slow degradation of guilt and regret and blame.\" She leaves to go home. Jane catches a last glimpse of Tom through the carriage window as he briefly follows, the horses outpacing him. Twenty years later, Jane, now a successful author and by choice unmarried, sees Tom pass by during a gathering. Her brother Henry, now married to Eliza, goes after Tom and brings him to her. Tom introduces his eldest daughter , who admires Jane\\'s novels. As she asks Jane to read aloud, he remonstrates her by her name, also Jane. Astonished that he named his eldest after her, Jane agrees to read. The last scene shows Tom\\'s daughter sitting by Jane as she reads aloud from Pride and Prejudice, while Tom watches Jane affectionately. As she concludes, their eyes meet, and Tom joins the rest of the company in honouring Jane and her work with applause.',\n",

Mandy is suffering an anxiety attack, as she has almost every night for months. Jeanne instructs her daughter to “use her strategies.” Finally, Jeanne distracts her out of this fit by singing a familiar lullaby: “Lady bug, lady bug, fly away home.” The next morning, Jeanne struggles to dress her 15 year-old daughter, who can’t yet do so by herself, and to board her onto the awaiting school bus. Afterwards, she walks their family beagle, while receiving a cell phone call from her free-lance business partner, Sue .

Jeanne rushes to the school, and encounters the dedicated but gruff principal, Liz Howell , who suggests this might not be the right placement for Mandy. Since Mandy’s failed in three different schools over the past two years, Jeanne is resolute to keep her in this one. Desperate for help, Jeanne calls Mandy’s father, Peter , asking if he could take Mandy for the weekend.

       "  'Omni Consumer Products , on the verge of bankruptcy, creates an armed force called the Urban Rehabilitators , under the command of Paul McDaggett . Ostensibly its purpose is to combat rising crime in Old Detroit, augmenting the ranks of the Detroit Police in apprehending violent criminals. In reality it has been set up to forcibly relocate the residents of Cadillac Heights, killing some of them  in the process. The Police force is gradually superseded by the Rehabs, and violent crime begins to spiral out of control. The Delta City dream of the former OCP CEO, \"Old Man\", lives on with the help of the Japanese zaibatsu Kanemitsu Corporation, which has bought a controlling stake in the organisation. Kanemitsu  sees the potential in the citywide redevelopment, and moves forward with the plans to remove the current citizens. The company develops and uses its own ninja robots  to help McDaggett and the OCP President  overcome the resistance of the anti-OCP militia forces. When RoboCop  and partner Anne Lewis  try to defend civilians from the Rehabs one night, Lewis is mortally wounded by McDaggett and eventually dies. Unable to fight back because of his \\'Fourth Directive\\' programming, RoboCop is saved by members of a resistance and eventually joins them. Due to severe damage sustained in the shoot-out RoboCop\\'s systems efficiency plummets, and he asks the resistance to summon Dr. Lazarus, one of the scientists who created him. Upon arrival she begins to treat him, deleting the Fourth Directive in the process. During an earlier raid on an armoury the resistance has picked up a jet-pack prototype, originally intended for RoboCop\\'s use, which Lazarus modifies and upgrades. After recovering from his injuries RoboCop conducts a one-man campaign against the Rehabs. He finds McDaggett and attempts to subdue him, but McDaggett is able to escape. McDagget then obtains information from a disgruntled resistance member  regarding the location of the resistance fighters base. The base is then attacked by the Rehabs and most of the resistance members are either killed or taken prisoner. Nikko escapes with the help of Lazarus before she is captured and taken to the OCP headquarters as a prisoner. RoboCop returns to the rebel base to find it abandoned. One of the Otomo ninjabots then arrives and attacks him. RoboCop experiences another power drain and his side-arm is destroyed, but eventually he is able to overcome his opponent. Meanwhile Nikko infiltrates the OCP building and assists Lazarus broadcast an improvised video, revealing that OCP is behind the outbreaks of criminality in the city and implicating them in the removal and termination of the Cadillac Heights residents. The broadcast causes OCP\\'s stock to plunge dramatically, driving the company into total ruin. McDaggett decides to execute an all-out strike against Cadillac Heights with the help of the Detroit City police department, but the outraged police officers refused to comply and instead defect to the resistance. As a result, McDaggett turns to hiring street gangs and hooligans to assist with his plans. Having heard Lazarus\\' broadcast Robocop takes to the air using the jet-pack. As the combined forces of the Rehabs and street gangs are about to wipe out the rebels and Detroit Police, RoboCop mounts an aerial assault on the attackers, leading to their defeat. He then proceeds to the OCP building and confronts the waiting McDaggett. Robocop is then attacked, and nearly defeated, by two Otomo robots. Nikko and Lazarus succeed in reprogramming them using a wireless link from a laptop computer, however, forcing them to attack each other. This triggers a timed self-destruct sequence in both units, forcing Robocop to flee. Igniting his jet-pack the flaming discharge hits McDaggett\\'s leg, immobilising him. Robocop escapes with Nikko and Lazarus, leaving McDaggett to perish in the blast while attempting to stop the self-destruct devices. As Old Detroit is being cleaned up Kanemitsu arrives and confronts RoboCop and his group, while his translator  tells the OCP president on Kanemitsu\\'s behalf that he is fired. Kanemitsu then bows to RoboCop. The deposed OCP President turns to Robocop and says \"Well, I gotta hand it to ya... what do they call you? Murphy, is it?\" RoboCop replies, saying \"My friends call me Murphy. You call me RoboCop.\"',\n",

At their first stop while touring the city, the Spanish Steps, the father suffers a heart attack dying in Martha’s arms. Martha soon discovers that her purse, containing all of her money, has been stolen in the confusion. She reaches for help at the German embassy and phones her mother giving her the bad news. Leaving the embassy, Martha crosses the path of a gentleman, who catches her eye – and she his. They are mutually mesmerized but keep going their own ways. Back in her hometown, Constance, Martha is ill received by her mother who blames her for her father’s death. Martha’s mother, an alcoholic, takes openly to drinking, tranquilizers and drawing mustaches on old photographs of her deceased husband. Martha turns down an offer of marriage from her boss at the library, who immediately proposes to her colleague Ilse. During the wedding celebration, Martha is formally introduced to Helmut Salomon, a wealthy civil engineer, who was the man she crossed glances leaving the German embassy. On their first conversation Helmut insults her by detailing her physical failings, and Martha meekly accepts these and responds by kissing him. Helmut takes her to an amusement park and insists that they take a ride together on the roller coaster, despite Martha being terrified of the idea. After the ride, she vomits and he proposes marriage. Martha, her face streaked with tears and vomit, thanks him and gleefully accepts. Martha's mother, in a hysterical reaction to the news that her daughter intends to marry, swallows an overdose of pills and collapses to the floor. Helmut takes the opportunity to have Martha’s mother institutionalized. The couple goes on honeymoon to the Italian coast. Helmut in addition to starting to control Martha’s diet refuses to allow her to apply suntan oil, deliberately ensuing that she gets sunburned. Once they are in their hotel room he has sex with the painfully sunburned Martha who screams. On they return to Constance, Helmut proves to be both sadistic and domineering. His sadism takes the form of bites on her neck and shoulders and his becoming aroused whenever she is in emotional or physical pain. Martha reaches out tentatively for guidance from her friend Marianne, but is unable to explain Helmut’s behavior. Marianne in any case is not much of a help. Helmut insists that they move out of Martha’s childhood home so that they can start anew. Without consulting her, he arranges for her to leave her job; he works at changing her musical tastes; he insists on her reading and memorizing an engineering text related to his work; he tries controlling her contact with the outside world; finally he has the telephone disconnected and does not allow her to leave the house anymore. Martha submits to her husband will with increasing reluctance. His violent sexuality is not stopped by her hysterical acts of resistance. When she tries to please him with some spontaneous gesture of giving, such as his favorite dinner or a new hairdo, she is ridiculed for her foolishness. Helmut frustrates Martha’s hopes at every turn. She wishes to start a family but her husband refuses to have children that can be deranged like Martha’s mother. After much begging Helmut allows her to have a pet cat, but shortly afterwards she finds the cat dead. One day, Martha finds Helmut waiting at home for her and he announces that he has a present for her in the bedroom. She interprets this as his intending to kill her. She races out and runs away, ultimately ending up looking for help with Mr. Kaiser a friend and colleague who she had trained at the library. He agrees to take her for a ride. She has become so paranoid, now, that she imagines that the car behind them is Helmut in pursuit. She grabs the wheel of the vehicle that she and Kaiser are in, causing the car to crash. Martha wakes up in the hospital and soon learns that Kaiser died in the accident and that she herself will be paralyzed for life in her lower body. She is told not to worry, however.

To save his infant son Kal-El, Jor-El launches a spacecraft containing the child towards Earth, a distant planet with a suitable atmosphere, and where Kal-El\\'s dense molecular structure will give him superhuman powers. Shortly after the launch, Krypton is destroyed. Three years later the ship lands near an American farming town, Smallville, where Kal-El is found by Jonathan and Martha Kent.

Lois becomes involved in a helicopter accident where conventional means of rescue are impossible, requiring Clark to use his powers in public for the first time to save her.

Teschmacher is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to a slow death. Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition that he will deal with the New Jersey missile first.

       "  'In the post Spanish Civil War years, Catalan kids would sit in circles among the ruins and tell stories, known as \"aventis\" open-ended narratives drifting back and forth through time. Laced with horror and perversity, these tales mix war stories, local gossip, comic book characters, fantasy and real events. The \"aventis\" of this film are told in flashback in 1970, 1940, 1936 and the mid 1980s. In 1970, Nito, a medical examiner assistant and sister Paulina, a nurse-nun  identify the corpse of a couple who had drowned during a car accident. The dead man is Daniel Javaloyes \"Java\", one of the main characters of the \"aventis\" of their childhood and adolescence. The woman seems to be Juanita, who forty years before was one of many orphans. The discovery of Java’s body  leads them to remember what had happened decades before. Flashbacks reveal a story that may or may not have happened. In the old quarter of 1940s Barcelona inhabitants are struggling to survive among the ruins left by the Spanish Civil War. Daniel Javaloyes, \"Java\" is one of them. He is a young man trying by any means to leave behind the misery around him. He lives in a dilapidated house with his grandmother, a mute trapper. To make some money, the hardened Java performs perverse sexual acts for the voyeuristic pleasure of Don Conrado, a rich sadistic man, who uses a wheelchair after being wounded during the war. In one of those sexual encounters for hire, Java has violent sex with Ramona, a visibly pregnant prostitute. From then on Java is smitten with the fallen woman. Initially he finds out very little about her, but when Conrado’s mother visits him also looking for her, Java learns that Ramona had been a maid in Don Conrado’s household. She bears a scarred left nipple caused by his sadism. Marcos, Java’s older brother, was an anarchist during the war and now is hiding on the grounds of the family’s house. He yearns to see his girlfriend Aurora Nin again, whose identity would be blended with Ramona’s in the stories told by Sarnita, one of the kids in Java’s neighborhood. Sarnita entertains his friends telling them aventis, mixing real events with others that have been invented. Aurora Nin and Java are prominent figures in those stories. Meanwhile, the perverse Don Conrado is directing a religious amateur play about the sacrifice of a Christian martyr. Fueguiña, one of the orphans in the institution where Paulina works, plays the leading role. Java wants to be an actor and blackmails Fueguiña in order to take the part of the devil in the play. Reluctantly Conrado allows him to participate, at least during rehearsals. Flash back to 1936. During the war, Marcos, fighting for the Republic, takes revenge on Don Conrado’s brutality towards his girlfriend Aurora Nin. When the men under Marco’s command do not find Conrado, they kill Conrado’s father instead. Conrado’s mother barely escapes with her life thanks to Aurora’s intervention. In one of his sexual assignments for Conrado, Java has a young man as a sexual partner instead of a woman. He does not back down, but knowing that Ado, the teenager, has been paid twice as much, he follows him to get a bigger share of the money. Through Ado, Java gets involved with a rich jewelry dealer. In him, Java sees the opportunity to escape his poverty-restricted life. In 1940, Marcos’ old cronies from the war are also looking for him. Still trying secret anti-government plots, they have resorted mainly to criminal activities. Palau, the leader of the gang has chosen his target: Menchu, a bleach blonde prostitute who works for the elite Falangist of the city. To strike them back, Palau and his partners Fusam and Sendra attack Menchu, brutally killing her. When his pursuit of Ramona proves aimless, Java, now sure that Ramona is in fact Aurora Nin, leads Ramona to Marcos’s secret hiding place and the former lovers are happily reunited. Taking advantage of a commotion in the neighborhood Marcos and Ramona managed to escape the city. In modern day Barcelona, by the mid 1980s, Palau, on a busy street, has a glance of an old couple asking for money. They seem to be Marcos and Aurora Nin.',\n",
       "  'A group of English schoolchildren, living in the midst of a war, are evacuated from England. Their airliner is shot down by briefly glimpsed fighter planes, and ditches near a remote island. The main character Ralph is seen walking through a tropical forest. He meets an intelligent and chubby boy, who reveals his school nickname was Piggy, but asks that Ralph not repeat that. The two go to the beach where they find a conch shell which Ralph blows to rally the other survivors. As they emerge from the jungle it becomes clear that only school pupils have escaped the crash. Singing is heard and a small column of school choir boys, wearing dark cloaks and hats, appears walking in pairs, led by a boy named Jack. The boys decide to appoint a chief. The vote goes to Ralph, and not Jack. Initially Ralph is able to steer the children  towards a reasonably civilised and co-operative society. Only boys holding the conch are allowed to speak during meetings. The choir boys make wooden spears, further reinforcing their appearance as an army within the group. Critically Jack has a knife, capable of killing an animal. The boys build shelters and start a fire using Piggy\\'s glasses. With no rescue in sight, the increasingly authoritarian and violence-prone Jack starts hunting and eventually finds a pig. Meanwhile, the fire, for which he and his \"hunters\" are responsible, goes out, keeping them hidden from a passing airplane. Piggy chastises Jack, and Jack strikes him in retaliation, knocking his glasses off, and breaking one lens on the rocks. Ralph is furious with Jack. Soon some of the children begin to talk of a beast that comes from the water. Jack, obsessed with this imagined threat, leaves the group to start a new tribe, one without rules, where the boys play and hunt all day. Soon, more follow until only a few, including Piggy, are left with Ralph. Events reach a crisis when a boy named Simon finds a sow\\'s head impaled on a stick, left by Jack as an offering to the Beast. He becomes hypnotized by the head, which has flies swarming all around it. Simon goes to what he believes to be the nest of the Beast, and finds a dead pilot under a hanging parachute. Simon runs to Jack\\'s camp to tell them the truth, only to be killed in the darkness by the frenzied children who mistake him for the Beast. The new group raids the old group\\'s camp and steals Piggy\\'s glasses. Ralph goes to talk to the new group using the still-present power of the conch to get their attention. However when Piggy takes the conch, they are not silent  but instead jeer. The boys push down a large rock and crush Piggy. Ralph hides in the jungle. Jack and his hunters set fires to smoke him out, and Ralph staggers across the smoke-covered island. Stumbling onto the beach, Ralph falls at the feet of a naval officer who stares in shock at the painted and spear-carrying savages that the children have become, before turning to his accompanying landing party. A small boy reaches up to the officer to check that he is real. The last scene shows Ralph weeping as flames spread across the island.',\n",

Before they can begin hunting, which the son does not want to do anyway, they are killed by flying jellyfish-like creatures, which penetrate their skin with needle-tipped tentacles. Some time later, four teenagers, Tom, Greg, Beth and Sandy, hike in the same area, ignoring the warnings of local truck stop owner Joe Taylor . A group of cub scouts is also in the area; their leader  is too killed by the alien creatures, while his troop run into an unidentified humanoid and flee. The teenagers set up camp at a lake, but after a few hours, Tom and Beth disappear. Sandy and Greg go looking for them and discover their bodies in an abandoned shack. They drive away in their van, while being attacked by one of the starfish which tries to get through the car\\'s windshield. After they get rid of it, they arrive at the truck stop. Greg tries to get help from the locals, but they do not believe him, except for Fred \\'Sarge\\' Dobbs , who is a mentally ill veteran. Meanwhile, Sandy encounters the humanoid and flees into the woods, where Joe Taylor finds and returns her to Greg. While they discuss the situation, the sheriff arrives, but Sarge shoots him and begins to become more paranoid. Greg and Sandy leave with Taylor, who reveals he has been attacked by the humanoid before and secretly keeps the flying jellyfish as trophies. They search for the shack and once there, Taylor goes inside to only find the bodies of Tom, Beth and the cub scout leader. They discuss waiting for the creature when Taylor is attacked by another \"jellyfish\". The young people run once again, leaving him behind as ordered. They stop a police car and get into the back seat, but find Sarge driving. He abducts them, believing them to be aliens. Greg plays along, telling the deranged man that an invasion force is on the way, thus distracting him enough to toss him aside, run away with Sandy and jump from a bridge. They make it to a house where they find new clothing and try to relax. In the night, Sandy wakes up and goes looking for Greg, only to discover that he has been killed by the alien, who is still in the room. She flees to the basement and the creature is about to get her when Taylor arrives and saves her. On the way to the shack, he tells her about the creature: it is a tall extraterrestrial  who hunts humans for sport to keep as trophies, using the living creatures as living weapons against its prey. They wait at the shack to ambush the hunter with dynamite when Sarge shows up, almost spoiling their plan. He and Taylor fight, and Sandy is about to hit Sarge from behind when the alien arrives and kills Sarge. Taylor then shoots the creature, with little to no effect. Realizing the last chance of success, he lures it to the shack, which is then blown up by Sandy. She alone survives the horrible night.',\n",

Some time later, David Andrews, a suburban single father, celebrates their young son Michael\\'s ninth birthday. The child receives the monkey from David\\'s girlfriend Susan, who purchased it at an antiques store. The monkey strikes its cymbals on its own accord.

David hires Adrienne, a fortune teller, to perform an exorcism on his home, but does not inform her about the monkey. Adrienne asks him if he has any statues or idols, explaining that demons often possess objects that are seemingly harmless, but use them as an outlet for their satanic activity. David realizes that the monkey is such an item, and is certain that a demon is in their home. He wants Adrienne to come and do an exorcism immediately. She tells him that she would need to find out more about his situation before she can intervene. She tells him that if it is a demon, she may not be able to help. David returns to the antiqes store and the clerk tells him an odd man brought it to the store the previous week after finding it in the ruins of the old woman\\'s house; the monkey showed no signs of fire damage, causing the clerk to disbelieve the story.

       "  'The Texas State University Fightin\\' Armadillos were once one of the most powerful teams in college football. However, shortly after winning consecutive national championships, massive NCAA violations resulted in the program having to forfeit several years\\' worth of victories. All of the previous players and coaches are banned from returning except Charlie Banks, the only \"clean\" player, who never got to play despite having \"heart\". The new coaching staff, led by Ed \"Straight Arrow\" Gennero , has nothing to assist them in building the team as no athletic scholarships are available, forcing them to hold tryouts. Along with this, they must worry about Dean Elias , who wants the team to fail so he can scrap it. However, the coaches soon have a makeshift team in place. Only 17 players are allowed on the team--not enough to have offense and defense--due to Dean Elias declaring many prospective players ineligible, so they are forced to play ironman football. The team lacks experience and talent in all areas, especially at quarterback, placekicker, and the defensive line. Assistant coach Wally \"Rig\" Riggendorf  recruits a 34 year old former high school star Paul Blake , who never attended college due to his father\\'s death. Rig convinces him to enroll and play for the team. Blake arrives on campus and catches everyone\\'s attention due to his age, especially Professor Carter . Paul then recruits a graduate student teaching assistant named Andre Krimm , who is also enrolled at the school and eligible to play for the team. Blake convinces him to join, and he is positioned on the defensive line, where he excelled years earlier. Even with the new members, the team continues to lose games. Things get so bad that, at one point during the film, announcer Chuck Neiderman  covers his microphone with his hands and screams, \"SHIT!!!!\" at the top of his lungs. Professor Carter tells Blake that she knows him from years earlier. Carter\\'s ex-boyfriend was a high school football star, but Blake and his team humiliated him and his team in a championship game. This episode actually caused Carter to become infatuated with Blake. Now, years after the fact, the two begin a romantic relationship, which Dean Elias opposes, due to the fact that Blake is a student, and Carter is a teacher. Coach Rig makes one more recruiting move to secure a kicker. He shocks everybody by selecting Lucy Draper  from the school\\'s soccer team. When she is brought on board, the team has its first taste of success, as Draper kicks a field goal in a driving rainstorm to forge a 3-3 tie with Kansas . After this game, Blake quits the team after arguments with the head coach  and Professor Carter, but convinces himself to come back after a teammate, who is also quitting, inadvertently changes his mind and both come back. With the coaches and players now on the same page, the team plays their last game of the season against the number one ranked team in the country, the University of Texas Colts, with whom the Armadillos were involved in a barroom brawl earlier in the season. They head into the game as huge underdogs, and without Coach Gennero, who is hospitalized just prior to the game, leaving Coach Rig in charge. After a horrible first half, they come back in the second half to make it a one point game with a few seconds left, and Gennero returns to the sideline, having only suffered from indigestion, though he lets Coach Rig call the final play. The team decides to try to win it all with a two-point conversion. They fake a point after attempt and pass for two. Blake scrambles and finally finds Banks in the end zone to win the game.',\n",

Fifteen years earlier, Barker had been falsely charged and banished by the corrupt Judge Turpin , who had lusted after his wife, Lucy . At Mrs. Nellie Lovett\\'s  meat pie shop on Fleet Street, he learns that Lucy poisoned herself with arsenic after Turpin raped her. Todd\\'s teenage daughter Johanna  is now Turpin\\'s ward and, like her mother before her, is the object of Turpin\\'s lust. Todd vows revenge, reopening his barber shop in the upstairs flat after Mrs. Lovett returns his old straight razors to him. While roaming London, Anthony spots Johanna in an upstairs room of a large house singing to her birds, and a beggar woman tells him her name. Anthony is instantly smitten with her, and Turpin invites him in, only for Turpin\\'s associate Beadle Bamford  to throw him out. Though Bamford warns Anthony that he will be punished if he is seen there again, the sailor becomes convinced that he and Johanna are meant to be together. During a visit to the marketplace, Todd denounces a fraudulent hair tonic by faux-Italian barber Adolfo Pirelli , and humiliates him in a public shaving contest, winning £5 and gaining the attention of Beadle Bamford. Todd becomes impatient while waiting for Beadle Bamford to arrive at his shop; Mrs. Lovett consoles him when Pirelli and his boy assistant Tobias Ragg ([[Ed Sanders  arrive. Mrs. Lovett keeps Toby occupied downstairs, while in the parlor Pirelli reveals himself to be Todd\\'s former assistant, Davy Collins, and threatens to reveal Todd\\'s secret to Beadle Bamford unless Todd gives him half his earnings. Instead of giving Pirelli a payoff, Todd beats him with a boiling kettle. He then stuffs Pirelli in a trunk to hide him from Toby, later slitting his throat upon realizing that he is still alive. After receiving some advice from Beadle, Turpin, intending to propose to Johanna, pays a visit to Todd\\'s parlor to groom himself. Todd shaves Turpin while preparing to slit his throat; before he can do so, however, they are interrupted by Anthony, who bursts in and reveals his plan to elope with Johanna before he realizes Turpin is there. Turpin leaves enraged, vowing never to return. His chance at revenge missed, Todd swears revenge on the entire world and vents his murderous rage upon his customers while waiting for another chance to kill Turpin. He is indiscriminate about his killings, believing that he is punishing the corrupt aristocracy for their exploitation of those below them, while saving the lower classes from their misery. Mrs. Lovett becomes his willing accomplice, suggesting they dispose of the bodies by baking them into pies to improve her business. Todd rigs his barber\\'s chair with a pedal-operated mechanism, which deposits his victims through a trap door into Lovett\\'s bakehouse. Meanwhile, Anthony begins to search for Johanna, who was sent by Turpin to Fogg\\'s insane asylum upon discovering her plans to elope with Anthony. The barbering and pie-making business prospers, and Lovett takes in Toby. With both of the shops being such a success, Mrs. Lovett informs Todd of her plans to move to the seaside. Anthony finally discovers Johanna\\'s whereabouts, and under advice from Todd, he poses as a wig-maker\\'s apprentice, who are allowed into asylums to collect hair for wigs, thus providing him the access he needs to rescue Johanna. Todd comes up with a new plan to lure Turpin back, and has Toby deliver a letter to him telling him where Johanna will be brought when Anthony frees her. Toby has become wary of Todd and tells Mrs. Lovett, unaware of her role in the crimes: he promises to protect her, loving her as a surrogate mother. Beadle Bamford arrives at the barber shop, informing them that neighbors complain of the stink coming out of the chimney. He is murdered by Todd, and Mrs. Lovett informs him of Toby\\'s suspicions. The pair search for Toby, whom Mrs. Lovett has locked in the basement bakehouse to keep him out of the way. Toby is nowhere to be found, having hidden in the sewers after seeing the Beadle\\'s body drop into the room from the trap door above, as well as finding a toe in a pie. Meanwhile, Anthony frees Johanna and brings her to the shop in disguise, while locking an asylum staff-member in a cell, where it is implied the inmates kill him. In Todd\\'s shop Johanna hides herself in a trunk in a corner of the room while Anthony finds a coach. The insane beggar woman who has been pestering Todd, Lovett and Anthony throughout the film makes her way into the shop seemingly searching for the Beadle. As Todd enters, she claims that she recognizes him. Just then, Turpin\\'s voice is heard. Todd quickly slits the beggar woman\\'s throat and deposits her body through the trap door. As Turpin enters, Todd explains to him that Johanna had repented, and offers a free shave. Todd reveals his true identity to Turpin and stabs him in the neck numerous times before finally slitting his throat and dropping him through the trap door. As Johanna peeks out of the trunk, Todd spots her and prepares to slit her throat as well, not recognizing her as his daughter. Upon hearing a scream from Lovett, he is distracted. He tells Johanna to \"forget my face\", and leaves her alive in his shop.

       "  \"One day after the events of Friday the 13th Part III, police and paramedics are busy cleaning up the mess that deformed mass murderer Jason Voorhees has left at Higgins Haven, including himself. Once delivered to the Wessex County Hospital morgue, it turns out that Jason is still alive. He rises, kills the morgue doctor, Axel, by sawing his neck with a bone saw, and then a nurse, Morgan, with a stab to the stomach, and heads back to Crystal Lake. A group of friends Paul, Sam, Sara, Doug, Ted, and Jimmy, have rented a house on Crystal Lake. On the way there, the group passes Mrs. Voorhees' tombstone and a female hitchhiker. After the group drives off the hitchhiker becomes Jason's next victim, stabbed in the throat while eating a banana. Next to the rental house is the Jarvis home. The group meets Trish and Tommy when they arrive. The next day, the group befriends twins Tina and Terri, who live in the area, and they all go skinny dipping at Crystal Point. Trish and Tommy, driving by, stop to see who is at Crystal Point and the group invites Trish to a party that night. Trish's car breaks down a bit further along the road, and they are helped by Rob, a hiker with mysterious reasons for visiting Crystal Lake, who soon becomes good friends with Trish and Tommy. Next door, the kids are enjoying themselves by dancing and listening to music. With four girls and four boys, each now has a date. However conflict ensues as some of the kids switch dates. These conflicts prove to be the least of their troubles as Jason predictably stalks and kills them one by one. Sam goes out skinny dipping and is impaled from under a raft. When Paul goes out to be with her, he is stabbed in the groin. Terri decides to leave early, and is about to get on her bike, but a spear gets rammed into her back. After sleeping with Tina, Jimmy decides to celebrate with a bottle of wine. While searching for a corkscrew, Jason emerges and impales the corkscrew into Jimmy's hand and then drives a meat cleaver into his face. Upstairs, Tina, looks out the window and is grabbed and thrown two stories down, landing on the car. While a stoned Ted watches vintage stag films, he gets too close to the projector screen and is stabbed in the head with a kitchen knife though the screen from the other side. After Doug and Sara finish making love in the shower, Jason attacks Doug, crushing his head against a shower tile. He then kills Sara by driving an ax through the front door when she tries to escape. At the Jarvis house, Trish and Tommy find their mother missing, so Trish goes to Rob for help. Rob explains that he's seeking revenge for the death of his sister, Sandy Dier . Trish and Rob take Gordon, the Jarvis family dog, next door to see what's going on. Tommy is left at home, and finds Rob's newspaper articles about Jason. At the house, a frightened Gordon jumps through a second story window. Jason kills Rob in the basement, and Trish flees back to her home intending to warn Tommy. After a long chase in and between the houses, Tommy shaves his head and makes himself up to look like Jason, which is effective in distracting Jason long enough for Trish to be able to attack him with his machete. She drops the machete as Tommy picks it up and swings it at Jason's head. Jason then falls to the floor, causing the machete to cut further into his head. As he embraces his sister, Tommy sees Jason's fingers begin to move, loses control and begins hacking Jason repeatedly with the machete, while Trish screams his name. The final scene of the film has Tommy visiting Trish in the hospital, and as they embrace and hope their nightmare is over, with a bizarre shot of Tommy psychotically looking towards the camera, kind of like the thousand yard stare.  An alternate ending to the film, included in the 2009 Deluxe Edition DVD, shows a dream sequence where Trish and Tommy wake up the next morning after killing Jason to the sound of police sirens. Trish sends Tommy to summon the police who have arrived next door. At that point she notices water dripping from the ceiling and goes to investigate. She enters the upstairs bathroom, and finds the body of her mother floating in a tub full of bloody water. Trish lifts her mother out of the tub, prompting Mrs. Jarvis' eyes to open, revealing them to be solid white and devoid of irses. Jason suddenly appears from behind the bathroom door and prepares to attack Trish. Trish then suddenly wakes up in the hospital in a scene reminiscent of the ending of the first movie. In his commentary, the director says this scene was cut because it interfered with the idea that this would be the final film.\",\n",

       "  \"  April 1945. The Nazi army is losing the war and Tito's Yugoslav partisans are rapidly gaining ground. Giulia is a woman who lives by singing in a tavern, in an unnamed village in what appears to be an ethnically Italian area of Istria. She had, six years before, a child, Carlo, from Novak, a Slav who has now become a partisan leader. It appears that Novak had raped Giulia, but Novak will later claim Giulia reported him to the police to get rid of him: the Italian police would rather believe an Italian woman than a Slavic man. The movie does not give a clear answer to which version is true. Novak comes back to Giulia to claim his child, but she refuses to give him to Novak; she attracts the attention of German soldiers, and Novak must flee. Francesco is an 8-year old child, only son of physician Giorgio Bottini and music schoolteacher Marta. He lives with his parents in the same village as Giulia and Carlo. He meets Ettore, an Alpino who is tired of war and drops his rifle in disgust when Francesco mentions that he likes heroes of war. Ettore has come back to meet again Anja, his girlfriend, who is Slavic and works at Don Bruno's orphanage.  Fearing for Carlo's safety, Giulia burns all his pictures so that Novak will not be able to recognize him, and gives Carlo to Don Bruno, the local priest, who takes him into his orphanage. Meanwhile, the Germans leave the village, which is taken shortly afterwards by the partisans. Novak enters a school, interrupting a music lesson of Francesco's mother, and orders all Italian books to be burnt. From this point, Novak will usually whistle the song the children were singing at various parts in the movie, making it his leitmotiv. At the same time, Francesco's father is threatened by Bostjan, Novak's henchman, and is forced to leave his clinic because he is Italian. Don Bruno has to give Carlo to Francesco's family, because he thinks his orphanage is too dangerous for him. Francesco and Carlo become officially brothers, even if Francesco at first rejects him.  The partisans start rounding up civilians, taking away everybody including children. Eventually, Francesco's family is also captured along with Carlo. On the trucks they are loaded on, children are separated from their parents, a scene that hints at Nazi concentration camps of the same war. It turns out that Novak wants all the children of the village to check, one by one, which one will react to the sight of Marta, whom he has kidnapped and keeps in his camp. Just before Carlo's turn, Anja manages to infiltrate the camp and take away Carlo and Francesco, with Ettore's help. Carlo and Francesco lose contact with their friends and return to an emptied home village. While waiting for help, German artillery starts pounding the village, and a shell makes Carlo deaf. Believing he cannot take care for him anymore, Francesco tries to bring Carlo back to Don Bruno's orphanage. On their way there, they see a convoy of partisans transporting Italian civilians, among them Francesco's parents. The civilians are gunned down by the partisans and thrown in a foiba, into which Francesco climbs down shortly after to find his parents dead, chained in iron wire. There is also a dying dog, which the partisans apparently threw down in order to keep the dead spirits from haunting them.  With the help of Ettore, Francesco and Carlo finally manage to reach Don Bruno's orphanage. Shortly after, Novak and his partisans reach the orphanage. Don Bruno, Anja and Ettore hide all the children, hoping that Novak will believe they have left to Italy. Novak, however, understands the priest's bluff, and orders his men to pour gasoline around the orphanage. Don Bruno, then, is forced to admit there still are children, and calls them out loud&mdash;but only the Slavic ones, thinking they do not have anything to fear from Novak. Novak, again not falling for Don Bruno's bluff, orders to set fire to the gasoline; the children have to exit, and Anja is recognized by Bostjan and captured for being a quisling. Carlo, Francesco and other two children, however, manage to escape through a conduit. Novak brings the children to his camp, again to show them to Giulia to understand whether one of them is his son. Don Bruno, when questioned, refuses to point out the child to Novak, because he considers him an assassin; Don Bruno is then kept prisoner by Novak.  The four children, having nowhere to go, reach Novak's camp and, whistling a code, find out that Don Bruno is in there. Francesco confronts Walter, a friend of his parents, who is still collaborating with the partisans; however, it turns out that he has been kept in the dark about Novak's ethnic cleansing. Walter offers himself to help contact Don Bruno, since he still has access to the partisans' base. He discovers that Anja and Giulia are also imprisoned in the same facility. Exiting the complex, Walter meets Francesco and Ettore, who has in the meantime escaped pursue by partisans. Ettore, disguised with a partisan's uniform, starts pouring gasoline through the base, taking advantage of the fact that most soldiers are drunk. At the same time, in the base, Bostjan rapes a helpless Anja. While Novak is interrogating Don Bruno, Ettore ignites the gasoline, causing a series of chain explosions in the base's weapon caches. While the partisans are busy trying to contain the damage, Walter liberates Don Bruno and tells him to go with the children to Gorizia by the mountains, to avoid partisan patrols. Don Bruno finds and liberates Anja, still shocked by Bostjan's rape, while Walter finds Giulia. Ettore, in the meantime, finds most of the Italian prisoners in the base and liberates them, but most of them are rapidly recaptured by the partisans. Giulia is finally reunited with her son Carlo, and together with Don Bruno, Ettore, Anja, Francesco and other children they take refuge in an abandoned coastal battery. They escape from the partisans' pursue by using a rope to reach the sea, but, to buy time and seal the door behind them, Giulia leaves them and surrenders to Novak. Walter reaches the coastal battery and confronts Novak, accusing him of genocide. Novak responds that that land is theirs, not the Italians', and that the Italians still have to pay a large debt . The following morning, the children's group reaches a small boat. Anja, still struggling with the memories of her rape, does not want to leave, but Don Bruno convinces her to continue. Ettore has by now understood that something terrible has happened, even if it is not clear how much he knows.  Novak brings the remaining Italian prisoners to another foiba, and guns them down in front of Walter and Giulia, who are kept aside. He then brings Giulia to the brink of the foiba, and asks her to come back to him, telling her he still loves her. Giulia eventually smiles to him, and jumps into the foiba. Novak, shocked, orders his troops to chase the children's group, but one of his lieutenants, Drasko, protests that the Communist party's orders are to march on Trieste, not to hunt down children and priests; he eventually leaves Novak, along with a group of partisans. The children's group is meanwhile proceeding through the mountains, avoiding partisan patrols. Trying to catch a hare with a slingshot, Francesco sets off a landmine, attracting Novak's attention. The children have to waste precious time as Ettore bears them out of the minefield, and are eventually cornered by Novak's forces. Novak, knowing they can hear him, threatens to kill Walter, still his prisoner, if his son is not brought to him. As Walter yells to them not to surrender because Novak is killing all the Italians, Novak shoots him.  As the children's group continue their escape, Ettore and Don Bruno visit the graves of Ettore's former comrades-in-arms. A group of veterans from campaigns in Greece and Albania, they were betrayed by a band of partisans who had asked them to join the resistance, and killed them with a machine gun as soon as they had handed over their arms. Ettore, after remembering them, takes back his guns from a cache he had left in a building close to his comrades' graves, and symbolically returns to be a soldier. He uses some dynamite to cut down a large tree in front of Novak's jeep, being dissuaded by Don Bruno from shooting at Novak with his rifle when he had the chance. Meanwhile, the children and Anja are found by Bostjan and one of his partisans, but as Bostjan threatens to execute Anja, Ettore arrives, immobilizes Bostjan and kills the other partisan. As Bostjan tries to grab a weapon, Ettore kills him too. Anja, shocked by the memories of her rape by Bostjan that have come back, tries to commit suicide by jumping off a cliff, but Ettore succeeds in dissuading her.  The group reaches another village, which proves to be devoid of any people. There, they meet the Pavans, an upper-class family fleeing from Maresco. Their car  has stalled and they are stranded with their luggage. The Pavans try to protect their wealth and provisions, and do not allow their well-dressed children to talk to the others. Yet, they join the group as they do not have alternatives, trying to bring with them part of their cumbersome luggage for some time. As they march on, Carlo is soon unable to walk due to a wound in his ankle, but he has finally regained his hearing. The group has to slow down, and Mr. Pavan grows nervous. Mr. Pavan learns that Carlo is the reason Novak is stalking them, and when his turn comes to carry him, he lags behind until he has a chance to bring the child to Novak, hoping he would let them go. Novak finally meets his son, but is ambushed by Ettore. Novak proposes to let the child decide where to go, but Carlo says he wants to go back to his mother. Ettore orders Novak and his men to drop their weapons, that are picked up by three Italian soldiers that Francesco had just stumbled upon. They leave Novak and his men unarmed and alive, and they proceed.  However, Novak surrendered easily because he knew the road to Gorizia was blocked, and that he had time to regroup. As the children's group, together with the soldiers, is forced to move towards the coastline, they find an abandoned fortress. Ettore and the Italian soldiers decide to remain there to delay the advance of Novak's soldiers, who are chasing them, accepting the implication that they will likely not survive the fight. At the abandoned fortress, Don Bruno quickly marries Ettore and Anja, since this could be their last time together. Mr. Pavan is forced to remain and fight, even if he tries to bribe his way out. When Novak and a dozen of his soldiers arrive, Mr. Pavan tries to surrender, only to be shot in the back by a partisan. Ettore and the other Italians continue to resist from their vantage position, and in the end only Novak and Ettore are left. Francesco, who has found a gun, runs back to the fortress to avenge his parents and kill Novak; Don Bruno runs after him, but arrives only in time to take the bullet from Novak's gun and save Francesco's life with his own; Ettore manages to grab a rifle and kills Novak. Ettore and Francesco find Anja and the other children in a long line of refugees bound for a merchant ship that will bring them back to Italy.\",\n",

The films cuts to Toby sitting in one of the four chairs in the dank room and a rubber gloved hand covers his mouth. Back to the remaining three, Molly asks Zoe to show her where she cut her leg. She brings them to a metal locker. Luke and Molly move the locker and a horrible smell is omitted from a huge hole in the wall. Luke stands in front of the hole and although we do not see him enter the whole in the wall, we are to assume he did as we get a glimpse of a few teeth in a wall pipe. The film cuts back to Toby as he is now tied to a metal bed/cot and he is thrashing in attempts to break free. A man in a hazmat type suit and a surgical mask quickly enters the room and gives him a sedative that knocks him out. The film cuts back to the remaining three. Zoe starts to verbally assault Luke and asks him what he saw, that he looked shaken up by what he saw. Luke claims he saw nothing, then confesses he saw mutilated body parts. Zoe and Molly are disturbed. As Molly and Luke are talking, Zoe walks back to the hole in the wall and peeks inside. As Luke and Molly realize Zoe is not in the room with them, they rush to the whole in the wall just as Zoe is being dragged in by the man in the hazmat suit. As Molly and Luke are now in a new room , Luke tells Molly not to look around as it is gorey. The film cuts to Zoe tied to a cot/metal bed. She can see the man in a hazmat suit cut out Toby\\'s eye and put it in a jar. The man then walks to Zoe. As she pleads for her life, she asks why is he doing his. He mumbles, \"for my father\". He exams Zoe\\'s cut leg, leaves the room, and then returns with a hack saw. The film cuts back to Molly and Luke as they find a key in the wall to the fuse box. As Luke opens the box and stats turning on lights, the lights in the room with the man and Zoe start to flicker. Annoyed by this, the man leaves Zoe to deal with Molly and Luke. Luke is hiding behind a door when he sees the hazmat suited man walk past slowly. Luke and Molly attack the man violently with planks only to find that the hazmat suited man tricked them and put Toby in the suit. Toby quickly dies and the old man appears behind Molly and Luke with the sleepIng gas. As Molly tries to drag herself away, Luke is dragged off into a room. Molly passes out. The film cuts back to the doctor returning to Zoe, who has almost freed herself. He slaps her across the face and begins to quickly cut her leg off. Molly awakes and is in the dank room with four chairs from the beginning. She sees the old man looking at her through a room but does not try to escape. She leaves the room and returns to the room where they spent the first night. She begins removing two stair railings and starts to break the stairs from underneath. She is then in a room eating an ice cube when the old man comes in and knocks her out. When she awakes, she is tied to a gurney. The man is about to cut her chest when he realizes he has no water in his bowl. Going upstairs to get water, the stairs Molly previously began destroying is starting to give way. The man returns without incident and attempts to cut Molly\\'s chest. He hears a noise upstairs and goes to check it out, leaving the scalpel on the gurney. Molly grabs the scalpel and begins to cut herself free. As the man comes down the stairs, he falls through the sabotaged steps, Molly grabs a wooden object and hits him in the head, knocking him out. She grabs his keys and begins running through the house trying to get free. Entering a room, she sees Luke with a plastic sheet covering him. The old man awakes and begins to get free from the stairs. Molly runs into what looks like the living quarters and finds a door out with a few locks. Fumbling for the right key, she cannot get the locks openned quick enough before the old man is in the same area she\\'s in. She hides behind a door while the man looks around for her. She sees a few newspaper articles about how a father was beaten in front of his son, and a few identification cards showing the old man was or is a surgeon. The man enters the same room Molly is in, but she has already snuck out and returned to the door to unlock it. The old man is standing in front of an urn  when he hears the jingle of the keys Molly is using to try and get free. The man quickly approaches Molly and attacks her. The movie goes silent, but the movie is showing her struggle with the man as he drags her though the house and throws her in a dark room. The sound returns as Molly is locked in the room with the only light is a TV that is knocked down and showing only static. She hears a sound and starts to see that there is another person in the room with her. It is the girl from the missing persons broadcast from the beginning of the movie , but she is clearly exhibiting animal instincts. The girl attacks Molly and the movie ends.',\n",

The film begins with the death of Riyo\\'s father, which leads Riyo\\'s aunt to make arrangements for Riyo to become a picture bride. As Riyo prepares to be photographed, her aunt shows her a picture of the handsome Matsuji , her husband-to-be in Hawaii. Not only is the photo intended as introduction, but also as a means of confirming that each has found the right partner when they meet for the first time on the docks. However, when Riyo finally arrives in Honolulu, the man who comes to greet her looks nothing like the man in the photo. Matsuji confesses that the photo he sent was old, taken when he was a young man. Riyo goes through with the wedding , and travels out to the sugar plantation which is her new home. As she walks past the darkened fields to their ramshackle house, Riyo hears a faint sound on the wind of a woman singing. When she asks about it, Matsuji half-jokes that the ghosts of the canefields have come to welcome her. That night, they sleep on the same mat, but Riyo fights off his attempts at sexual intimacy and hides beneath a blanket. The next day, after she is given an ID tag to wear around her neck, Riyo goes to work in the sugar cane fields for the first time. As a city girl, she is unfamiliar with farm work and slows the other workers down,leading her to be harassed and ridiculed by Antone  the Luna . Yayoi  prompts Kana  to help the Riyo learn. Kana is a young picture bride who had arrived several years before. Later, Riyo finds out that Kana\\'s husband, Kanzaki  frequently beats her and goes out gambling. To escape the abuse, at night Kana often brings her baby and sleeps in the fields, singing. One night, after an argument with Matsuji, Riyo runs off into the fields and discovers Kana. Riyo gains Kana\\'s trust, and agrees to help the other woman with her side business doing laundry for the workers. Riyo begins industriously doing laundry work and saving all her earnings in a tin can, determined to earn her passage back to Japan. Matsuji begins drinking and gambling, saying that he intends to win enough money to get another bride. Kana advises Matsuji to become romantic, and to take Rudolf Valentino as a role model in the task of winning Riyo\\'s heart. Antone the luna starts to drive the workers to do more work in order to meet the harvest in time. The women\\'s leader, Yayoi, leaves with her family to Honolulu. As she leaves, she asks Kana to take care of the other women caneworkers. In the fields, Kana and the other mothers are constantly worried about their children, who must be left, under a sunshade in the field when the parents are working. Kana tries to stand up against Antone to get the kids moved closer when the workers go to a new field. He threatens to use his whip on the workers, as he had done \\'in the old days.\\' Preparatory to harvesting, cane fields are set on fire to burn off the leaves. Antone, in a hurry to get the job done, orders the fire to be set before the women can retrieve their children. In the meantime, Kana\\'s baby daughter, Kei, has wandered into the fields. Kana rushes into the burning field to find her daughter, and both are lost. The workers talk about waging a strike. Meanwhile, Riyo continues to hear the sound of a woman singing in the canefields. One night, she leaves the house to follow the sound, and Matsuji follows her. He accuses her of having a secret lover and a chase ensues. Then, Riyo admits that her parents had died of tuberculosis, which at that time carried tremendous social stigma. Although Riyo herself was healthy, the matchmaker had lied to Matsuji about his bride-to-be\\'s outcast status. That night, when Riyo tentatively reaches out to him as they lie in bed, he brusquely turns away. Betrayed, the next day Riyo gathers her savings and a few belongings and runs away, eventually finding herself at the ocean. Riyo falls asleep there. She is awakened by the sound of singing, and glimpses a woman walking among the shoreline rocks. She runs after the vision, and encounters Kana, who says she is leaving for Japan. When Riyo asks to go with her, Kana criticizes her, not unkindly: \"Who waiting for you there?\" Then, as Yayoi had done when she left the plantation, Kana hands her neck tag to Riyo and tells her \"Take care of the girls.\" Kana turns to walk toward the sea, fading out of sight. Riyo awakes from her sleep, and finds Kana\\'s neck tag in her hand. She returns to the plantation and to her house, where she finds Matsuji drunk. She puts him to bed, and he looks at her, saying \"I thought I was all alone again.\" Later that night, she hesitantly reaches out to touch his hand, and he reaches back; they embrace. The next day, Riyo surprises the other workers when she begins singing in the fields, as had Kana and Yayo. Antone tries to make fun of her, but she continues singing more strongly, and he realizes that she has picked up the mantle of leadership. Matsuji makes a gift to Riyo of a Buddhist altar, so she can honor her parents. She is touched at his acceptance of her past.

In the entire 12 minutes, the old woman racially abuses the black man, stating that blacks stink, are unintelligent, criminal and the perfect carrier for AIDS. The biker feels uncomfortable, but does not dare to interrupt.

She speaks angrily and rapidly, but seems to have a language of her own. Looking at Violet\\'s bible, Dr. Lovell finds a note asking whoever finds it to look after her daughter, Nell . The sheriff, Todd Peterson , shows Dr. Lovell a news clipping from which Jerry surmises that Nell is the dead woman’s daughter, conceived by a rapist. Jerry seeks the help of Dr. Paula Olsen , a researcher working with autistic children. Paula and her colleague Dr. Paley  are interested in studying a \"wild child\" , and Dr. Paley continues to call Nell this even after studying films which show Nell does not fit the \"wild child\" profile. Doctors Paley and Olsen immediately get a court order giving them permission to institutionalize Nell for \"further study\". Lovell is warned just in time to get his own lawyer and prevent it. After legal maneuvering, a judge  gives Olsen and Lovell three months to interact with Nell and see what her actual needs are. Paula shows up on a houseboat with electronic equipment to monitor Nell\\'s behavior; Jerry chooses to stay in Nell\\'s cabin and quietly observe. Almost immediately Paula discovers that Nell\\'s language is English, based partly on her mother\\'s aphasic speech after a stroke. Jerry and Paula begin a grudging friendship, although he detests her coldly clinical, analytical tactics. Nell sleeps during the day or works inside her home, and is active outdoors only after sunset. She explains to Jerry that her mother told her about the rape and warned her that men were evildoers, citing Isaiah 1:4. As Nell comes to trust Jerry, she sees him as a friend, the \"gah\\'inja\" her mother promised would come. Jerry later realizes that \"gah\\'inja\" is Nell\\'s phrase for \"guardian angel.\" Using popcorn as an incentive, Jerry is able to lead Nell outside and into the sun. Afterward, Nell leads Jerry and Paula to the remains of a young child—it turns out that Nell once had an identical twin sister, May, who died in a fall while the two were playing in the woods. Nell treats May\\'s remains with reverence and love, rather than horror. Not long after, a reporter, Mike Ibarra , learns of Nell\\'s existence and visits her cabin. Nell is curious of the visitor at first, but is frightened by the flash when the reporter snaps a photo. At that moment Dr. Lovell arrives and throws the reporter out. The incident sparks an argument between Lovell and Olsen; Dr. Olsen believes that Nell would be safer in a hospital, while Dr. Lovell feels that Nell should be left alone and allowed to live as she pleases. Jerry and Paula decide that Nell should be shown a little of the world, and they make the decision to bring Nell into town. While in town, Nell befriends the sheriff\\'s depressed wife, Mary Peterson , but also has an ugly encounter in a pool hall with some raunchy boys until Dr. Lovell gets her out. Word of Nell\\'s existence spreads, prompting increased intrusion by the press, and Jerry and Paula are forced to spirit Nell away to a hospital for her protection. There, Nell becomes extremely despondent and unresponsive. Jerry removes her from the hospital and hides her in a hotel. Paula joins him, and at last they admit they love each other. At the court hearing the next day, Paula\\'s colleague Dr. Paley, who wants to study Nell in a controlled environment, delivers his opinion that Nell has Asperger syndrome and belongs in an institution.

However, for Yasumoto\\'s post-graduate medical training, he has been assigned to a rural clinic under the guidance of Akahige , Dr. Kyojō Niide . Dr. Niide may seem like a tyrannical task master, but in reality he is a compassionate clinic director. Initially, Yasumoto is livid at his posting, believing that he has little to gain from working under Akahige. Dr. Yasumoto feels that Dr. Niide is only interested in his medical notes and soon rebels against the clinic director. He refuses to wear his uniform, disdains the food and spartan environment, and enters the forbidden garden where he meets \"The Mantis\" , a mysterious patient that only Dr. Niide can treat. As Yasumoto struggles to come to terms with his situation, the film tells the story of a few of the clinic\\'s patients. One of them is Rokusuke, a dying man whom Dr. Niide discerns is troubled by a secret misery that is only revealed when his desperately unhappy daughter shows up. Another is Sahachi, a well-loved man of the town known for his generosity to his neighbors, who has a tragic connection to a woman whose corpse is discovered after a landslide. Dr. Niide brings Yasumoto along to rescue a sick twelve-year-old girl from a brothel  and then assigns the girl to Yasumoto as his first patient. Through his efforts to heal the traumatized girl, Yasumoto begins to understand the magnitude of cruelty and suffering around him as well as his power to ease that suffering, and learns to regret his vanity and selfishness. When Yasumoto himself falls ill, he is nursed back to health by the care and affection of Otoyo, the twelve-year-old girl who was saved from the brothel. Through his observations of Dr. Niide\\'s compassion and a series of destitute patients, Dr. Yasumoto learns what being a doctor really means. The lives of patients are more important than wealth or status. Their suffering can be ameliorated with compassion and conscientious care.',\n",

       "  'In 1813, the war turns in favour of the British. Lord Wellington ([[Hugh Fraser  is poised to invade southern France after triumphing in Spain. The Comte de Maquerre , a French nobleman, offers to raise a rebellion in Bordeaux against Napoleon. Major General Ross , is unconvinced, as his spies have reported no discontent in the region, but agrees that a brigade can be sent as a probe if the Comte can provide a secure base; he offers a family castle, though he admits that it is garrisoned. Wellington is forced to put a young, inexperienced Colonel Horace Bampfylde   in charge of the expedition, instead of Major Sharpe . Sharpe is reluctant to go, as he has just married Jane Gibbons  and she has come down with a deadly fever. Without quinine, her prognosis is bleak, but he is a soldier and he has his orders. Bampfylde botches the initial assault on the fortress and is driven back with heavy casualties. Disgusted, Sharpe and his men gain entry to the castle at night by a ruse, pretending to be a French patrol, and capture the place. The Comte is reunited with his sister  and gravely ill mother. For his trouble, Sharpe is sent by Bampfylde on a useless reconnaissance in order to grab the credit for himself. While Sharpe is away, the Comte brings the \"Mayor of Bordeaux\" to Bampfylde who confirms that Bordeaux is ripe for rebellion, however the mayor is in fact Napoleon\\'s agent and Sharpe\\'s old enemy Major Ducos , and the Comte is in league with Napoleon. Ducos also tells Bampfylde that Sharpe was ambushed and killed by a French column. Now convinced that his mission is a success and there\\'s no further reason to stay, Bampfylde is convinced by the Comte to demolish the front gates, blow up the captured ammunition, abandon the wounded, and return to Wellington immediately with the wonderful news. Sharpe\\'s patrol meanwhile ambushes and annihilates a French column of reinforcements, and captures a resupply cart and a doctor bringing quinine for the Comte\\'s mother. Resisting the temptation to save it for his wife, Sharpe allows it to be given to the ailing woman. Rifleman Robinson  is found with a local French girl. Sharpe is required to hang him by Wellington\\'s standing orders, but when the girl says she had been willing, Sharpe reduces the sentence to a beating from Sergeant Harper . Meanwhile they question the locals and find them fiercely loyal to Napoleon and conclude that the Comte\\'s rebellion is a sham. Hearing the explosion from the castle\\'s magazine, Sharpe and his men hurry back. When he gets a description of the mayor, he realises he has been trapped by Major Ducos. Not only will Wellington be tricked into advancing into an ambush, but Ducos will have his own personal revenge on Sharpe. French General Calvet  arrives with a sizable, but inexperienced, force. Under a flag of truce, the Comte reveals himself to be Napoleon\\'s agent, and offers to let the British go free provided they leave Sharpe behind; Robinson replies for them all, \"Fight them to the finish, sir.\" Sharpe turns them down. In a shooting contest, sharpshooters mortally wound the Comte in the back at long range as he returns from the parley. Sharpe and his men only have 18 rounds a man. Earlier, out of gratitude for Sharpe providing her mother with quinine, the Comte\\'s sister had told them to burn a cellar full of oyster shells to produce lime. The French attack, but are met by accurate volley shooting. With the British ammunition running low, Sharpe\\'s men dump powdered lime from the walls, blinding their foes as they enter the castle. The British form ranks and proceed to massacre the blinded Frenchmen. The French retreat just as the British run out of ammunition. Then, a messenger arrives from Marshal Soult, Calvet\\'s superior, wondering why he wasn\\'t guarding the flank when Wellington attacked... fifty miles away. The wily British commander had been suspicious and so only ever intended the uprising to be a distraction while he attacked elsewhere. General Calvet hurries away, leaving Sharpe victorious. When Sharpe gets back, Bampfylde is placed under arrest for cowardice and other charges. Sharpe is astounded to find his wife well; she tells him that Wellington had gone to some lengths to obtain quinine for her.',\n",

They remind him that he owes money to Darren Perrier , a local crime boss. The debt must be paid that night, or Ivan and Orlando will break two of Michael\\'s bones of his own choice. After they depart, Michael heads down stairs and sees Brenda , a friend of his, carrying a bouquet of flowers. She informs Michael that her boyfriend, Shamie , with whom she has a rocky relationship, has given her the flowers by way of apologising for his absenteeism. Michael is uninterested, and leaves the building in pursuit of a loan in order to pay off his current debt. Michael heads to Delgado\\'s Pool Hall, a nearby snooker bar, in search of a man known as The Mutt ([[Liam Cunningham , who is known to hand out loans. There, Michael finds his friend Clifford , who explains that The Mutt was only recently thrown out of the establishment; having assaulted a man for insulting his snooker skills. Leaving the bar, Michael gets into a kerfuffle with two clampers , who vow to find him and clamp his car later. Michael heads home only to find his father, Jim McCrea , waiting outside. Since he does not have the best relationship with his father, Michael is initially reluctant to talk. However, Jim reveals that he is dying of cancer and wishes to reconcile. The two head to a pub and begin to drink, but while there Michael learns of the location of The Mutt. He abandons his father, promising to talk later, and heads to The Mutt\\'s location. At this new pub, Michael runs into Shamie, who is making out with a girl. Michael, now angry, tells him he needs to show Brenda some respect and break off his ties with her if he wishes to pursue other girls. Michael then finds The Mutt, who is having a drink with his associate Dinny . He asks The Mutt for a loan, but is refused. Giving up, Michael begins to drink at the bar only to be assaulted by an angry Shamie. Michael overpowers Shamie and demands he break up with Brenda, but he must let her down lightly. Storming off, he is stopped by The Mutt, who asks if Michael will join him and Dinny in a burglary. The money earned will pay off Michael\\'s debt, but he won\\'t get it until morning. Michael agrees, and the three head out. The burglary goes off with out a hitch, and The Mutt finds pictures that prove the home owner is cheating on his wife. The trio plan to blackmail him out of €30,000. Michael is dropped off and is assured that he will get his €10,000 come morning. Back at his car, he finds the clampers have found him and clamped his car. Immediately thereafter, Ivan and Orlando return and drive their truck full speed into Michael\\'s clamped car. Michael flees the scene and is able to lose them, but he returns to his home in search of the pistol he keeps under his bed. Unfortunately, Brenda has stolen the gun and is contemplating suicide after being dumped by Shamie. She locks Michael out of her apartment just as Ivan and Orlando enter, having predicted that he would come home. They begin to beat Michael with a bat, and set his leg up against a radiator, preparing to break his leg. Before he can swing the bat, Orlando is shot dead by Brenda. Ivan, shocked, runs away to tell Perrier. While comforting Brenda, Jim enters and, upon noticing the body, tells them they need to properly dispose of Orlando. The three get into Brenda\\'s car and head up onto an escarpment, where they bury Orlando. Jim comments that the locale is beautiful, with the lights below and stars above and the waft of cow shit in the air. He also refers to the history of the area, commenting that men who lived and died by the sword were buried here. Unfortunately, Brenda\\'s car becomes flooded and they cannot get away, so Michael and Brenda spend the night in her car, while Jim stands outside, spending the whole night awake, watching Dublin. At Perrier\\'s hideout, he is discussing Orlando\\'s death with four other members of his crew. It is then revealed to him that, on top of being best mates, Ivan and Orlando were also lovers. Perrier goes to comfort the grieving Ivan, telling him that he is not judgmental about his homosexual relationship and that he will be putting a €10,000 bounty on Michael and Brenda. Back at Brenda\\'s car, it\\'s morning and Michael notices that his father has been up all night. Jim then admits that he does not have cancer, but instead believes he was visited by the Grim Reaper. During his visit, the Reaper informed Jim that the next time he sleeps, he will die. Upset that his father played on his sympathies, Michael angrily riles Brenda from her sleep and informs her that her car has to be burned. Once it is aflame, the trio head down the escarpment and back into the city. Unfortunately, they are caught in a rain storm and take shelter at a farm, but the owner, a strange old woman , calls the police and claims the trio raped her. Having fled down the road, they take cover upon seeing a Garda Síochána patrol car. Once it has passed, they cut through a forest but Brenda vows to make her relationship with Shamie work. An angry Michael then berates her for blindly loving Shamie despite the fact that he is unfaithful and does not love her back. While Jim takes him aside, Brenda storms off and, once they notice she is gone, Michael and Jim follow. They catch up with her as she is being arrested by two police officers. While sneaking up on them, Jim snatches Michael\\'s gun and confronts the officers, telling them to get off to the side and on the ground \"tout fucking suite.\" Once they are out of the way, the trio steal the cruiser and, shortly afterwards, Michael gets a call from The Mutt, who gives them his location in order for Michael to pick up his share of the blackmail earnings. With plans to meet The Mutt behind a factory at one in the afternoon, Brenda demands that, in the meantime, she be dropped off at Shamie\\'s so she can try to restore their relationship. Along the way, the trio encounter a young man ([[Chris Newman  and two of his mates joyriding in a stolen car. Jim and the man talk and the two trios swap cars. In their new stolen car, they arrive at Shamie\\'s; however, Brenda arrives just as a nearly naked woman strolls out and a nearly naked Shamie runs after her. The two start to get intimate in the hallway just as Shamie notices Brenda, but Brenda runs away. Outside the building, Brenda bypasses the car and runs down a nearby street, prompting Michael to chase after her and comfort her. Jim, left behind, approaches Jerome  and Russ , two members of the Savage Canine Vernacular, who are training their Doberman Pinschers to attack. Jim helps them, then picks up Michael and Brenda. They trio arrive at the warehouse and Michael heads in alone to get his share. He meets with The Mutt and Dinny, but the two plan on betraying him. The Mutt knocks Michael out with a wrench and he and Dinny carry the unconscious Michael to The Mutt\\'s car. As they are putting him in the boot, Jim approaches, armed with a pistol. He knocks both Dinny and The Mutt out while Brenda steals the entire €30,000. With Michael back in the car, the trio head out. Hiding out in another industrial area, Jim reveals the reason why Michael became estranged from his parents. After witnessing a local thug, Steve Lynch, beating up a woman, Michael intervened and beat up Lynch. Lynch returned to Michael\\'s house later, where only his mother, Elaine, was home. Lynch proceeded to assault Elaine, leaving her badly injured. Believing his parents blamed him for the attack, Michael broke off contact with them. Elaine and Jim would later split up, with Elaine moving to County Clare. Jim then asks Michael if he can have some cocaine, and Michael agrees, taking him to Delgado\\'s Pool Hall in order to buy off of Clifford. However, during the sale, Clifford signals Mulligan , who calls Perrier. While Jim is snorting coke in the bathroom and Michael and Brenda are talking, Perrier and his goons enter. Michael accidentally fires off his pistol, causing everyone to take cover. Other gang members, primarily Ivan, begin shooting but Brenda, angry at Clifford, beats him over the head and she and Michael use him as a human shield to escape. Clifford is killed in the process, and Jim is left behind. Upon exiting Delgado\\'s, the pair find that their stolen car has been clamped, and are forced to flee on foot. Thankfully, Shamie is able to find them in his car, announcing that he has been looking for Brenda. Michael and Brenda jump into his car. Outside Delgado\\'s, Perrier and his crew join with The Mutt and Dinny. Jerome and Russ approach, but their dogs growl and Perrier coldly shoots them. Jim walks out of the hall just as the gangs are leaving, but The Mutt notices him and he is taken hostage. Meanwhile, Shamie has tried to reconcile with Brenda, but she refuses him and her and Michael take his car at gunpoint. They take refuge in a hotel. They receive a call from a badly beaten Jim who explains to Michael that he is going to \"take a nap\" after the phone call - implying, true to his vision, that he will die. Despite this, Michael arms himself and prepares to go to Perrier\\'s hideout. Brenda tries to warn him against it, but the two share a passionate kiss and Michael heads out in Shamie\\'s car. Michael arrives at Perrier\\'s hideout, with the €30,000 and a pistol hidden in the crotch of his pants. He is informed that his father is going to die that night, though it will be quick. Michael\\'s death, however, will be slow. He is pinned down on the table while Ivan attempts to castrate him. Before it can be done, however, The Mutt asks for his money so he can leave. Perrier pockets the money, just as Hank  shoots and kills Dinny. In the confusion, Michael is able to escape, and Perrier kills The Mutt. Two of Perrier\\'s cronies pursue Michael, who has acquired a golf club. He uses it first to knock out Blaise  and then Victor . Michael, now armed with a pistol, returns and confronts Perrier, Ivan, Hank, and Kenny . Lining them up against a wall, Michael takes their guns and his money. Kenny calls his bluff, and is shot in the leg. Michael then pushes his father out of the building and loads him into Shamie\\'s car. At the same time, Perrier reveals that he has an AK-74u hidden under the snooker table. With that in hand, he, Ivan, and Hank head outside to confront Michael, who is attempting to flee. Perrier fires into the car as Michael reverses, and Jim is hit in the chest. They comment on how the Reaper came after all, and Jim calls him a cunt. An enraged Michael charges out of the car at Perrier, firing his gun, wounding Ivan and Hank in the process. Perrier shoots at Michael, severely wounding him. Before Perrier can finish him, multiple vans pull up, brought to the location by Brenda, containing members of the Savage Canine Vernacular. They set their dogs upon Perrier, who is mauled to death. Brenda, Jerome, and Russ inform a semi-conscious Michael that they\\'re taking him to Derek Dawson, the best veterinarian in the business. The next morning, Michael, having had his wounds treated, and Brenda are at the funeral for Jim, who is buried alongside Achilles and Apollo, Russ and Jerome\\'s dogs, at the same place that the trio had buried Orlando earlier. A heartfelt eulogy is given, and Michael and Brenda profess their love for each other. The pair then head to County Clare, where Michael intends to reconcile with his mother. The narrator, implied to be the Reaper, ponders as to whether the experience has made Michael a better man, possibly an enlightened man. He is shown waving at his mother before the camera fades out.',\n",

       "  'Jean Brodie is a teacher at the Marcia Blaine School for Girls in Edinburgh, Scotland in the 1930s. Known for her tendency to romanticize fascist leaders like Benito Mussolini and Francisco Franco, and believing herself to be in her prime of life, she devotes her time and energy to her four special girls, called the Brodie set: Sandy, Monica, Jenny and Mary McGregor. Mary, a new girl with a stutter who was an orphaned heiress, first had troubles with the other three, but they eventually became friends. The set often go to art museums, theatre, concerts, have picnics on the school lawn, among other things, which rather upsets the school\\'s austere headmistress, Emmeline Mackay, who dislikes the fact that the girls are cultured to the exclusion of hard knowledge, and the Brodie girls seem precocious for their age. She also seems to have a running grudge against Brodie, who has tenure. It was revealed that Brodie had been at Marcia Blaine for six years prior to Mackay being appointed headmistress. Besides working with her girls, Jean catches the eye of music teacher/church choirmaster Gordon Lowther, whom she and her girls spend a lot of time with at his home in Cramond, a seaside village on the outskirts of Edinburgh.  Mr. Lowther wants them to get married, but Brodie drags her feet. She still has feelings for her married ex-lover, Teddy Lloyd, who is the art teacher in the senior section of the school. Also working with Brodie  were Miss Campbell, the physical education teacher; Miss Ellen and Miss Allison Kerr, two sisters who serve as the school\\'s sewing teachers; Miss McKenzie, the strict librarian; and Miss Gaunt the headmistress\\'s mouselike, non-talking secretary. Miss Gaunt\\'s brother is a deacon at Mr. Lowther\\'s church  who eventually asks for his resignation as organist and elder because of his relationship with Miss Brodie. Between the years, Miss Brodie rises to her apex, and then spectacularly falls, given that Miss Mackay and most of the other teachers and staff at the very conservative school don\\'t want her to continue teaching there. During her downfall, she loses Mr. Lowther, who gets engaged to Miss Lockhart, the chemistry teacher in the Senior School, and one of the few teachers at Marcia Blaine who tended to be more sympathetic towards Miss Brodie as a person and to her teaching style. As the Brodie Set grow older and become students in the Senior School, Miss Brodie begins to cast her spell over a younger group of students, particularly a girl called Clara who reminds her of her favorite, Jenny. Mary, Monica and Jenny become closer friends, and Sandy becomes slightly distant from the set, although she is still part of it. Miss Brodie tries to manoeuvre Jenny and Mr. Lloyd into having an affair, and Sandy into spying on them for her. However it is actually Sandy  who has an affair with Mr. Lloyd. Sandy ends the affair because of Mr. Lloyd\\'s overwhelming obsession with Miss Brodie. Mary McGregor, influenced by Brodie, sets out to Spain to join her brother who she believes is fighting for Franco, but she is killed when her train is attacked shortly after crossing the frontier. This event serves as the last straw for Sandy, which leads her to betray Miss Brodie to Miss Mackay and the school\\'s board of governors, who finally decide to have Miss Brodie\\'s job terminated and another teacher to take over her classes. At the end, Sandy confronts Miss Brodie on her crimes, most especially her manipulation of Mary; her part in her senseless death ; and the harmful influence she exerted on other girls; and adds that Mary\\'s brother is actually fighting for the Spanish Republicans. Miss Brodie, on her part, makes some harsh but astute comments about Sandy\\'s character, particularly her ability to coldly judge and destroy others. Sandy retorts that Brodie professed to be an admirer of conquerers and then finally walks out of her classroom, with a frantic Miss Brodie following her to the landing screaming \"Assassin!!\" at Sandy. Sandy, however, doesn\\'t look back. After the confrontation, Sandy, Monica, and Jenny graduate along with the other girls. Despite knowing full well that she had betrayed Brodie to Mackay and the board of governors, Sandy did so out of concern for any other girl who could have been a target of Miss Brodie and her fanatical ways, and, perhaps too, resentment over Miss Brodie\\'s preference for Jenny and Teddy Lloyd\\'s unending obsession with Miss Brodie. At the end of the film as Sandy leaves the school for the last time, her face streaked with angry and bitter tears, Miss Brodie  states her motto: \"Little girls, I am in the business of putting old heads on young shoulders, and all my pupils are the crème de la crème. Give me a girl at an impressionable age, and she is mine for life.\"',\n",

       "  \"It is believed that 'Media' is the fourth pillar of democracy. Journalism began as a mission, then a service and now merely a profession - a complete business where a struggle is not to get right news but rather to 'generate' one crammed with glamour and sensation. The film endeavors to uncover the darker side of the famous or infamous sting operations where a news correspondent  falls in the 'chakravyu' of the whole business and finally paves her way out to yet another 'chakravyu'. The film narrates the story of a girl who initially is acknowledged when she is one among the corrupt system and discarded and criticized when she starts rebelling. Vidya is a young, dynamic, self-motivated news correspondent, who has just come out of a journalism course and is all charged to take up confrontations of this profession. But, little did she know that it is not as effortless job as it is perceived. Vidya initially is covering the entertainment beat and is quiet contended with her piece of work. But due to certain shuffles she is forced to quit entertainment and cover crime, which she presumes as not her cup of tea. Gradually, she gets a knack of it and starts getting addicted to the thrill and ecstasy of the job. She gets a brilliant story for her channel all the way from Rajasthan along with her team mates which actually boosts the TRP ratings of the channel and also her morale. In the process, or rather, in the quest for the thrill, she even tries to fool around with the so called ethics and codes of journalism by creating situations to get a story for her channel. One day she receives a call, that later changes her overall approach towards this profession. It is a call from a girl, Sangeeta, from Pune, who is a victim of repeated sexual abuses by the high designators of the local Police. Vidya, with her team chalks out a plan for yet another sting and is ready to cover the event where the SP is assaulting Sangeeta. But unfortunately it is the DIG who falls prey to their sting. The whole episode of 'live rape' disconcerts Vidya and her cameraman Rafiq to an extent that they feel ashamed to be merely a spectator in this profession where they couldn't even save the victim. But this event is not less than a celebration to the news channel where this 'Breaking news' will be their USP. Vidya has promised Sangeeta that this footage will not be telecast but rather be kept for her defense in court. Unfortunately, Vidya is traumatized to see the telecast of the whole footage 'as it is' in her news channel irrespective of her caution to the editor. Bugged with the whole system, she leaves for her Uncle's place who had been insisting her to visit his small press. There she apprehends the genuine power and nuance of journalism and gets the spur to fight back the system. With her, is a close friend Bala , Rafiq  and Trishna  who differ in their ideologies and yet are together. This is the time when she gets emotionally attached to the whole ball game and decides to give the victim Justice. In her fight for justice she faces all the ups and downs but all in vain leaving Vidya in utter despair and gloom. The USP of the film is in exposing reality with certain humorous incidence that occurs within the news channels. From the agitated talk shows to shoving the mike in the mouth of a kissing couple in a park and asking 'what is your take on right to privacy' is being presented in a unique style.\",\n",

After a quick fight, Shaft throws one of them out the window; while the other surrenders and reveals to him that Bumpy, the leader of an uptown gang, wanted to meet Shaft and knock him out at his office. At the police station, Shaft lies to Lt. Androzzi and his superior about the fight by saying that his friend got into an \"accident\". He is allowed to return to the streets for 48 hours. Shaft arranges a meeting with Bumpy, the leader of these gangsters, in his office. It turns out Bumpy\\'s daughter has been kidnapped, and Shaft is asked to get her back safe. Shaft starts his investigation by looking for a man named Ben Buford, who is revealed to have been part of \"the movement\" with Shaft years ago, and eventually finds out that Ben\\'s group is holding a meeting. Shaft then returns home to his girlfriend where they make love. The evening of the meeting, Shaft is tailed by a fingerman to the meeting where an ambush ensues. Shaft and Ben escape from the carnage while Ben\\'s group and the fingerman are murdered by unknown assailants. Ben confronts Shaft, thinking he was set up, but they refrain from fighting and move on. Shaft is told by Vic after the shooting that Shaft himself was the target, not Ben, and that there are brewing tensions between the \"uptown\" hoods belonging to Bumpy Jonas and the \"downtown\" Mafiosi, that have culminated in a couple of murders. Vic states those who know, know it\\'s \"hood against hood\" on the inside, but the perception is black against white to the general public, with the possibility of things escalating into full-blown race war on the streets of the city. He also shows Shaft some pictures of two of the Mafia men who just got to New York. Vic pleads to Shaft to just clue him in to what\\'s going on, though Vic already knew Bumpy was looking for Shaft. Shaft and Ben later meet Bumpy at his uptown office where Shaft ups the price for the job, based on his new-found information from Vic. Bumpy states that the reason for turning him on to Ben\\'s is because Shaft is going to need an army to get his daughter back, and \"Ben\\'s got one\". Shaft retires to the \"No Name Bar\", across the street from Shaft\\'s apartment in Greenwich Village. In the bar, he notices two men there who look like the Mafiosi from the pictures Vic showed him, watching Shaft\\'s apartment. Shaft takes over the bar from the bartender, and calls the cops without the two Mafiosi knowing. As the cops arrive to arrest the two men, one of them spits on Shaft\\'s face to which he responds by breaking a bottle of scotch over the man\\'s head. After spending the night with one of the ladies from the bar, Shaft visits Vic and the two Mafiosi the following morning. When Shaft returns home, he wakes the woman up, and as she leaves his place, she complains about his rotten manners out of bed, leading to a brief verbal spat. A few seconds after the woman leaves, Vic comes in echoing the woman\\'s spat to Shaft. Vic tells Shaft that the room that he was in at the station house was bugged and he is supposed to bring him in for questioning, but instead leaves. Ben and Shaft go to the apartment where Marcy Jonas is being held to make sure she\\'s alive. Once there, a gunfight ensues during which two hoods get killed and Shaft takes a bullet in the shoulder. At home where Shaft is getting medical attention from a doctor working underground with him , Shaft tells Ben to round up his men and meet him at the hotel where Marcy has been taken, to prepare to get her back. He also calls Bumpy to tell him that his daughter is fine and he is going to need some taxicabs to meet him at the same hotel for the getaway. As Shaft plan goes on it resembles a military commando-style operation, Ben\\'s men all dress as workers at the hotel  as to not arouse suspicion during infiltration. Shaft and one of Ben\\'s guys go to the roof and get set up to enter from the window of the room where Marcy is being held captive. Shaft\\'s plan is to cause a distraction with an explosive thrown through the window of Marcy\\'s room while Ben and his men come down the hall and deal with the Mafia men as they leave their rooms. The rescue plan is successful. Marcy is spirited out of the hotel into one of the waiting taxicabs; as the others get away in the remaining cabs, Shaft walks to a phone booth to call Vic. Shaft tells him his \"case just busted wide open\", to which Vic tells Shaft to close it for him. Shaft tells Vic that he won\\'t and declares, \"I guess you\\'re gonna have to close it yourself ... shitty!\" , howling in mockingly laughter and walking away as the closing credits begins to roll.',\n",

Meanwhile a boy named Chris Carson, a loner with a passionate obsession with the supernatural, and his father, workaholic Tim Carson, who is trying to demolish the Applegate Mansion in order to start his plans of a new renovation for the town. However a group of protesters are being led by Sheila Fistergraff are against the demolition of the building, which they consider a historic landmark.

Chris is disappointed that his father does not show up to his school\\'s open house that night and Sheila tries her best to comfort and support Chris.

Casper arrives at the mansion and finds Chris trying to escape. Tim gets his son out of the house and Casper eats the bomb which explodes in his stomach, saving the mansion.

       "  'The ESU Timberwolves are entering a season with high expectations after two disappointing seasons. The film begins with a loss to end the prior season, along with the school president putting pressure on Sam Winters  to win this coming season or face a possible firing. Sophomore quarterback Joe Kane  spends the Christmas bowl season with his alcoholic father and brother, while junior NFL prospect Alvin Mack  gives his mother a present to go with the new house she will soon have when he turns pro. The film then follows the recruiting of Darnell Jefferson , a highly rated running back, and his eventual commitment to ESU. During the recruiting phase, Jefferson is given a tour of the campus by Autumn , a beautiful young student, and the two bond immediately, sharing a kiss before they part ways. The film then cuts to the following fall, as football season is about to get underway. Jefferson is brought to a bar by Kane where he is introduced to Mack, backup QB Bobby Collins , who is dating Winters\\' daughter Louanne , and senior Steve Lattimer , who has played on the punt return team for the first three years of his college career but has somewhat mysteriously gained 35 pounds since last fall with the goal of starting in his senior year. Fall camp commences, with Jefferson fumbling during practice and subsequently forced to carry a football with him at all times. Winters warns that if any other player brings the football back to him, \"you\\'ll wish you were never born.\" Jefferson later reunites with Autumn, but discovers that she is dating the starting tailback Ray Griffen   and that when they last met the two were temporarily broken up because he had cheated on her with a white girl. Later on, Jefferson takes his entrance exams and worries about the test, going to Mack and Lattimer for advice. Lattimer tells him not to worry as it took him four times to pass the test, and he reveals that Mack is given copies of the test before he takes them and that, despite maintaining a high-enough GPA to be academically eligible at the university, Mack is functionally illiterate. Mack reassures Jefferson that the school will keep him eligible if he\\'s talented enough to play, and that all he needs to know how to do is sign an NFL contract. Jefferson is neither surprised nor worried when he finds out that he failed the test, and when recommended that he find a tuitor he chooses Autumn, who reluctantly agrees. Sports Illustrated runs a cover story on Kane and declares him a Heisman Trophy candidate, but he has trouble with the pressure put upon him by the school and its campaign prepared for him, and drinks to deal with his stress. He meets a tennis player, Camille,  and as their first date they go on a thrilling and scary motorcycle ride. They then develop a relationship. Mack is now a senior, simply waiting for the upcoming NFL Draft in March, and his indifference to academics is shown clearly in a tutoring session where he couldn\\'t care less about learning the material, but his strong ability to read offenses and football strategy during film study shows his commitment to football. Meanwhile, the offensive coordinator is worried that Lattimer is taking performance-enhancing drugs due to his increased size and ability and occasional displays of \\'roid rage. Coach Winters tells him that the amount of weight that Lattimer gained is far from impossible with steady work in the gym throughout the entire off-season, and that if he is taking steroids that the NCAA will catch him during a drug test. Later on, though, when he learns that he has been named a starting defensive end, Lattimer walks into the parking lot and shatters car windows with his head while screaming \"STARTING DEFENSE!! PLACE AT THE TABLE!!\" This is witnessed by several people, including both the offensivee and defensive coordinators, who agree not to tell Winters about the behavior, but decide to warn Lattimer that the NCAA will be drug-testing before the start of the season. Before the start of the season, the Heisman campaign for Kane picks up speed and the players\\' individual motivations for playing football is revealed. Kane enjoys playing because while he is on the field it allows him to be distracted from the stressors of his life, such as his alcoholic father and the increased publicity surrounding him. Jefferson is using football as a way to escape the ghetto. Mack enjoys the on-field battle and physicality of the sport. Lattimer simply displays a genuine love for the game. Before the start of the season, Lattimer is able to substitute clean urine for his own during the NCAA drug tests. The team then gets off to a good start with a convincing run of victories in the first half of the season. Meanwhile, Griffen is struggling to gain yards as the team\\'s tailback, and Jefferson is making the most of his playing time as a backup and punt returner. Jefferson is also disturbed when he begins receiving illegal monetary donations by wealthy alumni as his playing time and performance increases, though Mack tells him to take the money. Simultaneously, Jefferson and Autumn grow closer and begin a relationship, though Autumn is too ashamed to admit that she is dating him, described by Griffen as \"just another gang banger with speed,\" to her well-read father, another former ESU football player. She eventually resumes her relationship with Griffen, who is planning on attending medical school after he graduates. The film progresses to show the problems of a \"big-time\" football program. Winters\\' daughter is expelled for taking a test for Collins, who is subsequently kicked off the team and also expelled. Kane and ESU then lose a close game to Michigan, which pitted him against another Heisman candidate in Michigan\\'s quarterback, calling into question his ability to win the trophy. Lattimer then assaults a girl unwilling to \"hook up\" with him, but her father is a large football booster and gets her to drop the charges. Winters finally accepts that Lattimer is juicing and wants to suspend him for the season, but he is warned by his defensive coordinator that suspending him for doping when he had never failed a drug test would leave the school wide open for a lawsuit for jeopardizing his draft status. Lattimer is then suspended for three games after he admits the drug use to Winters, with the team running a cover story of a pulled hamstring to keep the doping under wraps. Lattimer then ceases taking steroids, with Winters telling him that the team will drug test him and that he will not be allowed in the stall alone when he urinates for the tests. Mack criticizes him, but Lattimer defends himself by saying \"Not everyone has your ability Alvin, you do what you have to do to play.\" After the loss to Michigan, Kane gets drunk in a bar and assaults another patron who accused him of smiling at his girlfriend, forcing the other man to be hospitalized. He flees the bar in another player\\'s truck that he borrowed without permission and is pulled over for drunk driving and charged with a DWI. Coach Winters negotiates a plea arrangement with the district attorney wherein all charges will be dropped if Kane successfully completes a 28-day program, although this will cause him to miss four games and more or less ends his Heisman candidacy. In addition, the team needs to win three more games in the next five weeks to win the conference championship and secure a major bowl game. But without a capable quarterback this does not seem possible. School officials then pressure Winters into letting Collins back on the team to start in Kane\\'s place. Winters reluctantly agrees, and goes so far as to vouch for Collins\\' character in front of the disciplinary committee despite the fact that his daughter was also expelled for cheating along with Collins and has no chance to gain re-admittance into the school. Collins is readmitted and the team goes 2-1 in the first three games with him under center, with strong defense and a relentless ground attack leading to their success. Lattimer passes his drug test after sitting out for three weeks and returns for the second-to-last game of the season against Iowa and the fourth start of the season for Collins at quarterback. The game is close most of the way, but Mack suffers a career-ending injury late in the fourth quarter and Lattimer is run over at the goal line by Iowa\\'s running back for the game\\'s winning score. Kane then completes his 28-day program and attempts to reconcile with Camille, whom he refused to speak to while in rehab. He also reaches out to his father, who has never seen him play before, and gives him a plane ticket to Florida for the team\\'s final game of the season. Meanwhile, Lattimer resumes taking steroids and has an associate remove the tainted urine from his bladder and replace it with clean urine in a painful and dangerous procedure so that he can pass his next drug test. ESU has a final game against Georgia Tech. This game will win the Eastern Athletic Conference  and secure a major bowl game. Before the start of the game Jefferson is named the team\\'s starting tailback and Griffen is moved to fullback. GT leads the game 10-0 at the half. Kane was benched for Collins but asked to start in the 2nd half. As he takes the field at the start of the second half, Kane looks into the stands for his father and realizes he is not there, but accepts that he will never see him play. Kane struggles to regain his rhythm in the third quarter, but the game remains close, thanks in part to a goal-line tackle made by Lattimer to save the game. After making the tackle Winters looks into Lattimer\\'s eyes on the sideline and notices that they are bloodshot and distorted and realizes that he has somehow managed to continue taking steroids without failing a drug test. Lattimer looks to the ground in disappointment, although Winters seems to understand his decision to take the drugs and pats him on the helmet. Kane rallies the team to victory in the fourth quarter and secures a major bowl game, saving Winters\\' job, with both coach and quarterback realizing that Kane will likely make another, more-promising run at the Heisman in his senior season. Lattimer sits on the bench and cries instead of celebrating with the team, as he realizes he will not be able to play in the NFL without performance-enhancing drugs.

       "  \"The film opens with a flashback to the Vietnam War, where Norman Hopper  is bitten by a U.S. POW Charlie Bukowski , who is infected with a virus which leaves people with a craving for human flesh. In Atlanta, Georgia, some years later, Hopper wakes up from a nightmare about this incident, and then receives a phone call from Bukowski, who invites his old comrade out for a drink. The call came in at an inopportune moment, as a young neighbour girl, Mary, was trying to seduce him, so he turns down the invitation. Hopper falls for her charms and as they are about to engage in oral sex, he bites her. After hearing from his concerned wife that a Vietnam vet barricaded himself in a mall, he gets into his car. Just as he is about to leave, Mary reveals that she enjoyed the bite. After arriving on the scene, he convinces Bukowski to surrender to the police. While being hauled away to the hospital, Bukowski bites a police constable. After returning home, Hopper instructs his wife to wait for him in the house, and walks in front of Mary's window. Later, he admits to the incident and his wish to bite a fellow-human, to his wife. At the hospital, Bukowski is seen by his fellow vet with blood staining his chin, who proceeds to bite Helen's leg. Dr Mendez calls Jane Hopper and tells her that Norman might be experiencing the same symptoms and that she should bring him over to the hospital for a checkup, while he is listening in on the conversation, after which he leaves the house. The police get the coroner's report on the mall shootout and it contains warnings of cannibalism. At the same time, Jane meets Dr. Mendez, who has been trying to seduce her before. They are at a fancy piano bar, where he explains to her that the virus causes a biological mutation, due to psychic alteration. Norman voluntarily goes to the hospital and talks to a doctor about his symptoms and his well-founded suspicions on Dr. Mendez' intentions with his wife. The doctor also takes a blood sample. At the police station, the bitten constable shoots a fellow cop, bites another cop and ends up shot by Captain McCoy. Norman comes across his sedated fellow vets Charlie and Tommy. He experiences a flashback to the initial incident where he got bit by an infected POW. The doctor gets attacked by Helen while inspecting Hopper's blood sample. First she bites off his tongue and then she bashes his head in with a rock. In an ambulance the bitten cop gets aggressive before she dies. In the hospital, Helen frees Tommy and Charlie. Norman kills a staff member who tries to notify the authorities. Norman, Helen, Tom and Charlie leave the hospital in an ambulance. Jane returns to an empty house and searches for Norman when the phone rings and Dr. Mendez notifies her that Norman disappeared. The police are on high alert and looking for the escapees. The escapees break into a tire shop and find a gun. Charlie uses an Angle grinder to slice up a victim. Tommy steals a station wagon and the infected leave with a pistol and a bag of snacks. They get confronted by a biker gang that Charlie already fought at the mall, killing one of their members. After defeating the gang, they run away on foot just as the police arrive on the scene and escape into the sewer. The police coordinate a blockade of the sewer exits in order to trap the suspects. At the Hopper residence, Jane is unable to make a telephone call and goes next door to ask Mary's aunt to use the phone. Mary and her brother greet her and let her use the phone to call Dr. Mendez, but the aunt is nowhere to be seen. The children behave suspiciously and ask her how come her phone is not working, but they let her leave. In the sewer, Helen gets attacked by a rat just as the cannibals are about to slip away from the police. She ends up being shot along with a cop. Charlie gets killed by the police, while Norman gets wounded. Tom goes berserk, attacks the police and gets killed with a Flamethrower. Even with a wounded leg, Norman crawls out of the sewer, steals a car and leaves the scene. Jane tries to leave the house in her car but cannot start it. As she comes back into the house, she hears strange noises and calls for Norman. She finds him in his dress uniform, telling her to stay away. Norman is hurt and dying, and Dr. Mendez walks into the house. Jane runs over to him, but he bites her as Norman shoots him.

After the Russian Empire is overthrown and the Soviet Union is born, most of the Western diplomats evacuate. Stephen is left behind with just a servant, \"Poohbah\" Evans.

Just as the soldiers start shooting, news arrives that Lenin will recover, and that he has ordered the release of all political prisoners. Later, Stephen and Elena depart for England; at the train station, Medill requests they send him a supply of bubble gum.',\n",

       "  'The film begins circa 2008  with an elderly Lady Thatcher buying milk unrecognized by other customers and walking back from the shop alone. Over the course of three days we see her struggle with dementia and with the lack of power that comes with old age, while looking back on defining moments of her personal and professional life, on which she reminisces with her  husband, Denis Thatcher. She is shown as having difficulty distinguishing between the past and present. A theme throughout the film is the personal price which Thatcher has paid for power. Denis is portrayed as somewhat ambivalent about his wife\\'s rise to power, her son Mark lives in South Africa and is shown as having little contact with his mother, and it is implied that Thatcher\\'s relationship with her daughter Carol is at times strained. In flashback we are shown Thatcher\\'s youth, working in the family grocery store in Grantham, listening to the political speeches of her father, whom she idolized - it is also hinted that she had a poor relationship with her mother, a housewife - and announcing that she has won a place at the University of Oxford. She remembers her struggle, as a young lower-middle class woman, to break into a snobbish male-dominated Tory party and find a seat in the House of Commons, along with businessman Denis Thatcher\\'s marriage proposal to her. Her struggles to fit in as a \"Lady Member\" of the House, and as Education Secretary in Edward Heath\\'s cabinet are also shown, as are her friendship with Airey Neave , her decision to stand for Leader of the Conservative Party, and her voice coaching and image change. Further flashbacks examine historical events during her time as Prime Minister of the United Kingdom including the rising unemployment related to her monetarist policies and the tight 1981 budget , the Brixton Riots of 1981, the miners\\' strike of 1984–5, and the bombing of the Grand Hotel during the 1984 Conservative Party Conference, when she and Denis were almost killed. We also see  her decision to retake the Falkland Islands following the islands\\' invasion by Argentina in 1982, the sinking of the ARA General Belgrano and Britain\\'s subsequent victory in the Falklands War, her friendship with Ronald Reagan and emergence as a world figure, and the economic boom of the late 1980s. By 1990 Thatcher is shown as an imperious but aging figure, ranting aggressively at her Cabinet, refusing to accept that the Community Charge  is regarded as unjust, and fiercely opposed to European Integration. Her deputy Geoffrey Howe resigns after being humiliated by her in a Cabinet meeting, Michael Heseltine challenges her for the party leadership and her loss of support from her Cabinet colleagues leaves her little choice but to resign as Prime Minister, about which she is shown as still angry and bitter twenty years later. Eventually, Margaret is shown packing up her late husband\\'s belongings, and telling him it\\'s time for him to go. Denis\\'s ghost leaves her fully dressed but without his shoes - in spite of her cries that she is not yet ready to lose him, and she is left alone washing up a teacup.',\n",

       "  \"Littlefoot and his friends are constantly being bullied and browbeaten by three teenage dinosaurs: Hyp, a Hypsilophodon; Nod, a Nodosaurus; and Mutt, a Muttaburrasaurus. However, when a shower of flying rocks impacts near the Great Valley and causes a rock slide in the Mysterious Beyond, which blocks the water supply of the Great Valley, Hyp, Nod, and Mutt are no longer the biggest worry of Littlefoot and his friends. The increasing lack of water causes conflicts between the inhabitants of the Great Valley, who have lived in relative peace and harmony until this event. When the interspecies situation becomes worse and worse, Littlefoot and the others set out to find water, whereby to keep the peace in the Great Valley. They are pursued by Hyp and his cohorts. When Littlefoot and the others find a small lake, the teenagers emerge and claim the waterhole for themselves, demanding that Littlefoot and the others keep silent about their discovery. Unwilling to comply, Littlefoot and the others flee from the bullies and during the following pursuit, the bullies are then chased away by a wasp after Mutt accidentally called it a dummy, and the kids discover the reason for the blockage of the Great Valley’s water source. Before they can return and tell the other Valley inhabitants the truth, the storm approaches, a lightning strike on a tree, ignites a wildfire that spreads rapidly through the dried Valley. The dinosaurs barely make it to safety at the edge of the Mysterious Beyond while the fire ravages their home. When the protagonists tell the other dinosaurs of their discovery of the water's being blocked in the Mysterious Beyond by the rock slide, disunity about what to do prevents the adult dinosaurs from doing anything to utilize this knowledge. Hyp, Mutt, and Nod set out into the Mysterious Beyond on their own to get to the water first. Anticipating the danger to which Hyp and his cohorts have exposed themselves, and recognizing commonality with them, Littlefoot and the others follow them, in order to help if necessary. It becomes necessary when a pool of water Hyp enters turns out to be a dangerous tar pit. Littlefoot and the others pull him out of the tar by combined effort. Soon afterwards, the adult dinosaurs appear in search of their offspring and are united by the understanding that it was the unity of their children that helped them to find water. It is implied during the discussion thereof that Hyp's own experience of harsh treatment by his father is the cause of his harshness toward others after he bullies Littlefoot and the others and leads the argument of Cera's father and Littlefoot's grandfather with Cera's dad calling Littlefoot a bad influence enraging Grandpa which he causes, and implied later that being treated kindly improves the temperaments of Hyp and his sidekicks. Before they are able to take further steps, the herd is attacked by a pack of four small Sharpteeth. The following pursuit leads to the bed of the now dry river that flows through the Great Valley and exactly to the spot where a dam of boulders created by the rockslide has blocked the river. During the following encounter between the sharpteeth and the herbivorous dinosaurs, the unity of the children &mdash; a group which now includes Hyp and his cronies &mdash; proves elemental. Cera's father, Littlefoot's grandfather, and later Hyp's father keep the sharpteeth occupied while Cera and the now placid teenagers succeed in breaking the dam. They all watch as the freed water washes away the sharpteeth . The herbivores return to the Valley, which now has enough water for them, although the fire has destroyed most of the plants on which they feed. Working together, the dinosaurs survive the time until the plants start to grow again by feeding on the last remains of the plants, moving from one verdant area to another and sharing everything they find; a behavior which gives this time its name “The Time of the Great Giving”.\",\n",

Because there are no details other than the time, he goes to the diner twice each day at 8:09, to await her arrival. He works as a small-time magician in Las Vegas, where he supplements his income with gambling, using his powers to win against the house. He draws the attention of FBI agent Callie Ferris , who has figured out his ability and wants to stop terrorists from detonating a nuclear weapon. Before Ferris can approach Cris, however, his gambling draws the attention of casino security. On his way out of the casino, he stops an imminent robbery, yet is chased by security agents. Using his ability to forecast the actions of his pursuers, he eludes both of them and Las Vegas police. Ferris tracks Cris to his home, but he escapes after foreseeing her arrival. Later that night, the casino\\'s security chief is approached by two of the terrorists, is interrogated about Johnson and is then killed. The following morning, Cris is at the diner again when he sees Liz Cooper , the woman from his vision. It turns out that not only can Cris see the future, but can see the effects of what any number of his actions can do to that future. After envisioning a number of different approaches—all of which fall flat—he meets Liz after intervening when her ex-boyfriend arrives. Knowing that she is heading for Flagstaff, Arizona, Cris charms her into giving him a ride. Ferris follows, while the terrorists decide to kill him. A washed-out road forces Cris and Liz to spend the night in a motel. With the weapon tracked to Los Angeles, Ferris convinces her superiors to let her bring Cris in. The terrorists follow in the hope that the agents will lead them to Cris. Later that day, Agent Ferris confronts Liz while she is walking near the hotel. Claiming Cris is a dangerous sociopath, she asks her to drug Cris so that they can bring him in peacefully. Instead, Liz warns Cris, who tells her about his secret. When she asks why he will not help the FBI stop the terrorists, he explains his limitations, noting the exception for events involving her. Asking for Liz to wait for him, he tries to escape from the FBI agents waiting to arrest him but is captured after saving Ferris from logs tumbling down the side of a mountain. Unable to kill Cris, the terrorists kidnap Liz instead. In custody, Cris is strapped to a chair with his eyes held open and forced to watch television until he has a vision that can help the FBI. Expecting him to see a report about the detonation of the bomb, instead he envisions a broadcast from several hours in the future in which Liz is killed by a bomb while strapped to a wheelchair as bait for Cris. Cris escapes from captivity and races to the parking garage where she will be killed. Pursuing Cris to the garage, Ferris promises to help save her as long as Cris will help stop the bomb, and sets up a plan to draw out the terrorists. Using his ability, Cris helps the FBI track the terrorists to the port where they are based. When they arrive, after a series of exchanges, Cris is able to walk right up to the terrorist leader and avoid being hit, by seeing where the bullets will go and dodging them. After killing the terrorists and saving Liz, they find that the bomb has already been moved. Ferris shows Cris a seismograph hoping that he will see any tremors caused by explosions before they happen. As he stares at the screen he realizes that he has made a mistake and that he was too late; the bomb detonates out at sea and completely destroys the port, as well as the rest of the city.

       "  'In Bandrika, a fictional country in an \"uncivilised\" region of immediately pre-World War II Central Europe,It has often been wrongly stated that the action of the movie is set in Nazi-controlled Austria, though Bandrika may be seen as a substitute for such. Bandrika\\'s fictitious language has similarities to Italian, Hungarian and German, although it is unlikely to be Hungary as two travelers reference their previous stop in Hungary. Three of the railway stations seen or mentioned within the country are \"Zolnay\", \"Dravka\", and \"Morsken\". a motley group of travellers eager to return to England is delayed by an avalanche that has blocked the railway tracks. At night, a folk singer plays a tune al fresco that catches the attention of Miss Froy , an elderly lady who has worked some years abroad as a governess. The folk singer is suddenly silenced--apparently murdered.The Lady Vanishes: All Aboard!, by Geoffrey O\\'Brien Among the train\\'s passengers are Gilbert , a young musicologist who has been studying the folk songs of the region, Iris , a young woman of independent means who has spent a holiday with some friends, but is now returning home to get married, and Miss Froy. When the train resumes its journey, Iris and Miss Froy become acquainted, while the remaining passengers in the compartment appear not to understand a word of English. Iris lapses into unconsciousness, the result of an earlier encounter with a falling flowerpot meant for Miss Froy. When Iris reawakens, the governess has vanished, and she is shocked to learn that the other passengers claim Miss Froy never existed. The other English travelers deny ever seeing her, for their own reasons. Fellow passenger Doctor Egon Hartz  convinces everyone that Iris must have hallucinated the scene with the old lady because of the blow to her head. Undaunted, Iris starts to investigate, joined only by a skeptical Gilbert, with whom she eventually falls in love. They discover that Miss Froy is being held prisoner in a sealed-off compartment supposedly occupied by a seriously ill patient being transported to an operation. They manage to free her, but the train is diverted to a side track, where a shootout ensues. Miss Froy intimates to Gilbert and Iris that she is in fact a British spy assigned to deliver some vital information  to the Foreign Office in London; after entrusting her message  to Gilbert, she flees under cover of the shootout. After managing to restart the train and escape, Gilbert and Iris return to London. At the Foreign Office, Gilbert, driven to joyful distraction when Iris accepts his marriage proposal, forgets the tune. Just as it appears the message has been lost, the coded folk song is heard in the background. Fortunately, Miss Froy had been able to escape, and is revealed playing the song on a piano. The plot of Hitchcock\\'s film differs considerably from White\\'s novel. In The Wheel Spins, Miss Froy really is an innocent old lady looking forward to seeing her octogenarian parents; she is abducted because she knows something  that would cause trouble for the local authorities if it came out. Iris\\' mental confusion is due to sunstroke, not a blow to the head. In White\\'s novel, the wheel keeps spinning: the train never stops, and there is no final shootout. Additionally, the supporting cast differs somewhat; for instance, in the novel, the Gilbert character is Max Hare, a young English engineer building a dam in the hills who knows the local language, and there is also a modern-languages professor character who acts as Iris\\'s and Max\\'s interpreter who does not appear in the film. The characters Charters and Caldicott were created for the film, and do not appear in the novel. The story was used again in the series Alfred Hitchcock Presents, in the episode \"Into Thin Air\".',\n",

They have a heart-to-heart talk and he apologizes deeply for his actions. He is interrupted by Arya, who is dying after being inflicted with arrows. With Arya dying in his arms, Asoka suddenly realizes that his enemies, his family, and even Arya, are all dead, because of him. His grandfather's advice about the sword had been right. The film ends with Asoka throwing the sword at the same spot his grandfather had thrown it and embracing Buddhism. The final narrative describes how Asoka not only built a large empire, but spread Buddhism and the winds of peace through it.\",\n",

       "  'In ancient times, the gods Zeus, Poseidon, and Hades betrayed their parents, the Titans, and banished them to the Underworld with the help of the Kraken, a sea monster born of Hades. The gods divided the Universe among themselves; Zeus took the skies, Poseidon took the seas, and Hades, tricked by Zeus, was left with the Underworld. The gods created the mortals, whose faith in them assured their immortality; however, as time passed, mortals began to question them. Years later, \"Perseus\" is fishing with his family when they witness soldiers from the city of Argos destroying a statue of Zeus. The gods, infuriated at this desecration, unleash the Furies - flying beasts who pursue mortal sinners. The furies attack the soldiers and destroy the fishing vessel. Only Perseus survives and is found by a group of soldiers from Argos. Perseus is brought before King Cepheus and Queen Cassiopeia who are celebrating the campaign against the gods. Queen Cassiopeia brashly compares her daughter Princess Andromeda to the gods and boasts she is more beautiful than Aphrodite. The revelry is cut short by the arrival of Hades, who has been given leave by Zeus to punish the mortals for their defiance. Hades states that he will unleash the Kraken against Argos unless Andromeda is offered as a sacrifice. Before leaving, he reveals that Perseus is a demigod, the son of Zeus. In captivity, Perseus meets Io, who tells him of his origin. Io also reveals that she was cursed with immortality after she refused Poseidon\\'s advances and has watched over Perseus his entire life. She has always protected him, as he is the only one who can defeat the gods. Perseus is asked to lead the King\\'s Guard to visit the Stygian Witches in order to discover a way to kill the Kraken. Wishing to avenge the death of his family, Perseus accepts. Zeus is convinced by Apollo to give Perseus a chance and presents him with an enchanted sword forged on Mt. Olympus and a winged horse named Pegasus. Perseus refuses both gifts but Draco puts the sword into safekeeping. Shortly thereafter, they are attacked by Calibos. Draco severs Calibos\\'s hand causing Calibos to flee. The band gives chase but is attacked by giant scorpions called Scorpiochs summoned by Calibos’s blood. They are saved by the Djinn, a band of non-human desert sorcerers led by Sheik Suleiman. The Djinn, also wishing for the gods\\' defeat, lend their aid to Perseus and his band. The group arrives at the lair of the Stygian Witches and learns from them that the only possibility for killing the Kraken lies with the head of the gorgon Medusa who resides in a temple in the Underworld. Medusa can turn any creature made of flesh into stone that makes eye contact with her gaze, and thus using her head is the only way to stop the Kraken. Perseus, Io, Suleiman, Draco and his remaining men Solon, Eusebius, and Ixas cross into the Underworld and enter Medusa\\'s temple lair while Io remains outside, unable to enter the temple as a woman. Suleiman and Draco both wound Medusa, sacrificing themselves in the process and setting the stage for Perseus to behead her with his eyes closed. As he is leaving the temple with Medusa\\'s head, he witnesses Calibos appear behind Io and fatally stab her. Perseus and Calibos engage in mortal combat and as he finally comes to terms with who he is, Perseus picks up the Olympian sword and pierces Calibos through the chest. Before dying, Io urges a reluctant Perseus to leave her and save Andromeda and Argos before she dissolves into a golden ethereal vapor. Perseus mounts Pegasus and hastens back to Argos as the solar eclipse begins and Zeus orders the Kraken\\'s release. The Cult goes to the palace and seizes Andromeda in order to offer her to the Kraken. In an intense aerial chase with Perseus riding Pegasus, he manages to retrieve the bag and expose Medusa\\'s face to the Kraken, making eye contact just before it is able to eat Andromeda. The Kraken slowly turns into a massive stone statue which cracks and falls apart. Perseus raises his sword to the heavens and calling upon Zeus, throws his sword at Hades. A lightning bolt engulfs the sword which expels Hades and banishes him to the Underworld once more. Perseus rescues Andromeda, now the rightful Queen of Argos. Andromeda asks Perseus to stay by her side as King, but he declines. Perseus also refuses another offer of godhood from Zeus, who then states that if Perseus is to live as a human he should not be alone, and subsequently revives Io.',\n",

As the hitmen walk toward North\\'s upstairs classroom, the teacher receives a call warning him of their arrival. Johnny sadly responds, \"It\\'s okay. I know them.\" As he calmly waits at his desk, Charlie and Lee enter and shoot him multiple times. As they are departing the town by train, Charlie admits that he is bothered that North refused to flee, and that they were paid an unusually high fee for such a simple hit. He and Lee run through what they know about the man they have just killed. Johnny was once a champion race car driver whose career ended in a violent crash. Four years before his death, he was involved in a million-dollar robbery of a mail truck. Tempted by the missing million, Charlie and Lee visit Miami to interview Johnny\\'s former mechanic. Earl Sylvester , who considers himself Johnny\\'s only friend, is devastated to learn of his death. In between sobs and gulps of whiskey, he tells the story as he remembers it. Johnny North was at the top of his profession when he met the beautiful Sheila Farr . Despite Earl\\'s suspicions, Johnny fell deeply in love and planned to propose marriage after winning his next big race. However, Johnny\\'s late nights with Sheila had left him disoriented from lack of sleep. As a result, his racing career ended with a fiery crash. At the hospital, Earl revealed to Johnny that Sheila was the mistress of mob boss Jack Browning . Known for her extravagant taste, Sheila has already cheated on Browning with several other sports figures, all of whom met bad ends. Enraged and heartbroken, Johnny rebuffed Sheila\\'s attempts to explain and cut his ties to her. Intrigued, Charlie and Lee approach a former member of Browning\\'s crew, who also reveals his memories. Some time after the crash, Sheila found Johnny working as a pit mechanic during another race. Although Johnny bitterly attempted to drive her away, Sheila insisted on telling him that a much better job might soon be his for the taking. Meanwhile, Browning was in the process of planning the robbery of a U.S. postal truck. On Sheila\\'s recommendation, he agreed to take Johnny on as his getaway driver. After Johnny refused to return her calls, Sheila called at his dilapidated tenement. Although Johnny still felt betrayed, Sheila said that she had always regretted losing him and could not live without him. Deeply moved, Johnny agreed to forgive her. He also helped Browning by souping up the getaway car. However, Browning was deeply enraged when he learned that Sheila had returned to Johnny. In a deliberate provocation, Browning brutally slapped Sheila in front of Johnny. Enraged, Johnny instantly punched Browning in the face and threatened to kill him if he ever hurt Sheila again. However, they both agreed to \"settle this\" after the job, and went back to planning the robbery. Browning and North placed a phony detour sign to send the mail truck onto an isolated mountain road, while Browning\\'s other accomplices blocked the road by staging an accident. When the truck stopped, the gang held it up at gunpoint, loading more than $1 million into the getaway car. Johnny then forced Browning out of the moving car, and drove off alone with the money. After listening to this story, Charlie and Lee pay a visit to Jack Browning, who is now a real estate developer in Los Angeles. Browning, however, insists that he is now an honest businessman and has no idea what happened to the money. He does, however, reveal that Sheila is staying at a downtown hotel and agrees to arrange a meeting with her. To deprive Browning of time to plan an ambush, Charlie and Lee call at Sheila\\'s hotel room several hours earlier than agreed. At first Sheila denies all knowledge of Johnny or the money. However, Charlie and Lee beat her and dangle her by the ankles out of her seventh-story window. Terrified, she agrees to tell them the truth. The night before the robbery, she entered Johnny\\'s room and told him that his life was in danger. Browning, she said, was planning to kill him and pocket his share of the robbery. Enraged, Johnny wanted to leave and kill Browning on the spot. Sheila, however, insisted that she had a much better idea. On her advice, Johnny threw Browning out of the car and drove off with the money. Later that night, he met with Sheila. As the two lovers departed with the money to a nearby hotel room, they were confronted by Browning. Sheila asked Browning to \"do it quickly,\" and the gangster shot Johnny in the torso. Although severely wounded, Johnny escaped into the night. Unable to find him, Sheila expressed fear that Johnny would cause as much trouble as his predecessors. Therefore, Browning hired Charlie and Lee to murder him. As Sheila comes to the end of her story, Charlie understands at last why Johnny refused to flee. The only man who refuses to run is a man who considers himself to be already dead. Sheila\\'s betrayal had already killed Johnny long before the bullets ever touched him. Charlie and Lee, with Sheila in tow, then leave the hotel to confront Browning; but he is waiting nearby with a sniper rifle. He kills Lee and wounds Charlie. Browning and Sheila return home. As they prepare to flee with the money, Charlie, mortally wounded, enters. Sheila, at last revealing her sociopathic nature, frantically denies any role in Johnny\\'s death, insisting that her husband alone was responsible. Charlie calmly shoots Browning dead and turns his revolver toward Sheila. When she again pleads for her life, Charlie snarls, \"Lady, I don\\'t have the time!\" He kills Sheila with a single bullet and staggers out the door. He falls dead on the lawn while still gripping the money.',\n",
       "  'A Senate Armed Services Committee interviews a candidate for the position of Secretary of the Navy. Senator Lillian DeHaven  from Texas criticizes the Navy for not being gender-neutral. Behind the curtains, a deal is struck: If women compare favorably with men in a series of test cases, the military will integrate women fully into all branches of the Navy. The first test is the training course of the  U.S. Navy Combined Reconnaissance Team . Senator DeHaven hand-picks Lieutenant Jordan O\\'Neil , because she is physically more feminine than the other candidates. To make the grade, O\\'Neil must survive a grueling selection program in which almost 60 percent of all candidates wash out, most in the first week . The enigmatic Command Master Chief John James Urgayle  runs the brutal training program that involves 20-hour days of tasks designed to wear down recruits\\' physical and mental strength, including pushing giant ship fenders up beach dunes, working through obstacle courses, and hauling landing rafts. Given a 30-second time allowance in an obstacle course, O\\'Neil demands to be held to the same standards as the male trainees. Eight weeks into the program, she suffers a vicious beating, with her arms tied behind her back, from the Master Chief during SERE training, during which he tries to convince the other trainees that the presence of a woman will make them more vulnerable in combat. O\\'Neil fights back, and is successful in causing him some injury despite her immobilized arms. In so doing, she acquires respect from him, as well as from the other trainees. Navy leaders, confident that a woman would quickly drop out, become concerned. Civilian media learn of O\\'Neil\\'s involvement, and she becomes a sensation known as \"G.I. Jane.\" Soon she must contend with trumped-up charges that she is a lesbian, and is fraternizing with women. O\\'Neil is told that she will be given a desk job during the investigation and, if cleared, will need to repeat her training. She decides to \"ring out\"  rather than accept a desk job. It is later revealed that the photo evidence of O\\'Neil\\'s alleged fraternization came from Senator DeHaven\\'s office. DeHaven never intended for O\\'Neil to succeed; she used O\\'Neil as a bargaining chip in trade to prevent military base closings in her home state . O\\'Neil threatens to expose DeHaven, who then has the charges voided and O\\'Neil restored to the program. The final phase of training  is interrupted by an emergency situation that requires the SEAL trainees\\' support. The situation involves a reconnaissance satellite powered by weapons-grade plutonium that fell into the Libyan desert. A team of U.S. Army Rangers is dispatched to retrieve the plutonium, but their evacuation plan fails, and the SEAL trainees are sent to assist the Rangers. The Master Chief\\'s shooting of a Libyan soldier to protect O\\'Neil leads to a confrontation with a Libyan patrol. During the mission, O\\'Neil displays a definitive ability in leadership and strategy while rescuing the injured Master Chief, whom she and McCool pull out of an explosives-laden \"kill zone.\" With helicopter gunships delivering the final assault to the defenders, the rescue mission on the Libyan coast is a success. Upon their return, all those who participated in the mission are accepted to the CRT. Urgayle gives O\\'Neil his Navy Cross and a book of poetry containing a short poem, \"Self-Pity\", by D. H. Lawrence, as acknowledgment of her accomplishment and in gratitude for rescuing him.',\n",

       "  \"Shortly after the Columbine High School massacre, Union Intermediate High School  was one of many schools around the country increasing security measures to prevent school shootings. Brandi Blackbear wrote horror stories similar to those of Stephen King, dressed in a slightly Gothlike way, and was not afraid to be herself, or to stand up to bullying by popular kids. Her defiance engendered hostility toward her from certain segments of her school's culture. False stories of threats of violence were circulated, and the combination of her writing and authorities' natural hyperawareness following Columbine led to her being suspended. When some of her fellow students later saw her checking out a book on world religions, including Wicca , they immediately branded her a witch, and eventually accused her of casting a spell that made a teacher sick. Fear of her spread through much of the school, and she was once again suspended. Finally, her parents went to the ACLU, where they were told they had a good case against the school for violating her civil rights. The ACLU sued the affluent school for $10 million, even though the Blackbears were not sure they deserved that much based on what Brandi had suffered. Still, the ACLU argued that the school would not take any lesser claim seriously. When the school offered a settlement, the Blackbears refused. They were not interested in the money, despite needing it; what they really wanted was to have their story heard in court to inform the public that the school had mistreated Brandi. The judge ruled to dismiss the charges rather than going to trial, and ordered the Blackbears to pay $6000 in court fees, which they could not afford. Eventually it was agreed to drop the fees if the Blackbears dropped their appeal. Earlier that day at school however, Kimberly  tries to interview Brandi for the school newspaper but She declines, and also, everyone at school expreses their admiration for Brandi, causing Kimberly to lose her popularity.\",\n",
       "  \"Set on the fictional San Piedro Island in the northern Puget Sound region of the Washington state coast in 1950, the plot revolves around the murder case of Kazuo Miyamoto , a Japanese American accused of killing Carl Heine, a Caucasian fisherman. The trial occurs in the midst of deep anti-Japanese sentiments following World War II. Covering the case is the editor of the town's one-man newspaper, Ishmael Chambers , a World War II veteran who lost an arm fighting the Japanese in the Pacific. Ishmael struggles with his love for Kazuo's wife, Hatsue , and his conscience, wondering if Kazuo is truly innocent. Spearheading the prosecution are the town's sheriff, Art Moran , and prosecutor, Alvin Hooks . Leading the defense is the old, experienced attorney Nels Gudmundsson . An underlying theme throughout the trial is prejudice. Several witnesses, including Etta Heine , Carl's mother, accuse Kazuo of murdering Carl for racial and personal reasons. Etta is a stereotypical anti-Japanese person; she represents the part of America that persecuted Japanese Americans during the Second World War. This stance is not without irony, as Kazuo (a decorated war veteran of the [[442nd Infantry Regiment , experienced prejudice because of his ancestry, following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. By the same standard, Etta, a German American, could be blamed for Nazi war crimes. Also involved in the trial is Ole Jurgensen, an elderly man who sold his strawberry field to Carl. The strawberry field is a contested issue during the trial. The land was originally owned by Carl Heine Sr. The Miyamotos lived in a house on the Heines' land and picked strawberries for Carl Sr. Kazuo and Carl Jr. were close friends as children. Kazuo's father eventually approached Carl Sr. about purchasing  of the farm. Though Etta opposed the sale, Carl Sr. agreed. The payments were to be made over a ten-year period. However, before the last payment was made, war erupted between the U.S. and Japan, and all islanders of Japanese ancestry were forced to relocate to internment camps. In 1944, Carl Sr. died and Etta sold the land to Ole. When Kazuo returned after the war, he was extremely bitter toward Etta for reneging on the land sale. When Ole suffered a stroke and decided to sell the farm, he was approached by Carl Jr., hours before Kazuo arrived, to try to buy the land back. During the trial, the land is presented as a family feud and the motivation behind Carl's murder. Ishmael's search of the maritime records reveals on the night that Carl Heine died a freighter had passed through the channel where Carl had been fishing at 1:42am, five minutes before his watch had stopped. Ishmael realises that Carl was thrown overboard by the force of the freighter's wake. Despite the bitterness he feels at Hatsue's rejection, Ishmael comes forward with the new information. Further evidence is collected in support of the conclusion that Carl had climbed the boat's mast to cut down a lantern, been knocked from the mast by the freighter's wake, hit his head, then fallen into the sea. The charges against Kazuo are dismissed.\",\n",

       "  'Set in the 1910s, the story opens with a Grand Prix race, in which one of the cars swerves to avoid a dog, loses control, crashes, and catches fire, bringing its racing career to an end. The car ends up in an old garage, where two children, Jeremy and Jemima Potts, have grown fond of it, but are told by a junkman that he intends to buy the car for scrap; to crush it then melt it down to a liquid and have the metal to sell. The two children, who live with their widowed father Caractacus Potts, an eccentric inventor and his equally peculiar parent, implore him to buy the car before the junkman does, but he is unable to, not having the money. While skipping school, they meet Truly Scrumptious, a beautiful upper-class woman with her own motorcar, who brings them home to report their truancy to their father. Truly shows interest in Caractacus\\' odd inventions, but he is affronted by her attempts to tell him that his children should be in school. One night, while going over his bizarre inventions, many of which seem to be similar in function and form to modern appliances, such as vacuum cleaners and televisions, Caractacus discovers that one of the sweets he has invented can be played like a flute. He tries to sell the \"Toot Sweet\" to Truly\\'s father Lord Scrumptious, a major confection manufacturer, but when the factory is overrun by dogs responding to the whistle, he is thrown out. Then he takes his automatic hair-cutting machine to a carnival to raise money, but it goes haywire. He eludes the wrath from his first  customer named Cyril by joining a song-and-dance act, stealing the show and earning enough tips to pay for the car. Potts rebuilds the car, which he nicknames Chitty Chitty Bang Bang for the noises its engine makes, and he and the children, accompanied by Truly, go for a picnic on the beach, where Truly becomes very fond of the Potts family and vice versa. Caractacus tells them a story about nasty Baron Bomburst, the tyrant ruler of fictional Vulgaria, who wants to steal Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and keep it all for himself: In the story, the quartet and the car are stranded by high tide, but Chitty suddenly deploys huge flotation devices and they escape inland. The Baron sends two comical spies ashore to capture the car for him, but they briefly capture Lord Scrumptious by accident, and then kidnap Grandpa Potts, mistaking him for the inventor of Chitty. Caractacus, Truly, and the children see him being taken away by airship, and give chase. When they accidentally drive off a cliff, Chitty sprouts wings and propellers and begins to fly. They follow the airship to Vulgaria, where the Baroness Bomburst has ordered the imprisonment of all children, whom she abhors. Grandpa the \"inventor\" has been ordered by the baron to make another floating car, and is bluffing to avoid being tortured. The Potts party is hidden by the local toymaker, who now works only for the baron. Chitty is discovered and taken to the castle. But while Caractacus and the toymaker go in search of Grandpa and Truly goes in search of food, the children are captured by the Baron\\'s Child Catcher. The toymaker takes Truly and Caractacus to a grotto far beneath the castle where the townspeople have been hiding their children, and they concoct a scheme to free the children and the village from the baron. The toymaker sneaks them into the castle disguised as life-size dolls, gifts for the baron\\'s birthday. Caractacus snares the Baron and the town\\'s children swarm into the banquet hall overcoming the baron\\'s palace guards and guests. In the ensuing chaos, the baron, baroness, and Child Catcher are all captured. The family is freed and fly back with Truly to England. Jeremy and Jemima finish the story themselves: \"And Daddy and Truly were married!\" which Truly seems to find appealing, but Caractacus is evasive, believing that the class distance between them is too great. When they arrive home, Caractacus is surprised to find his father and Lord Scrumptious  playing a lively game of soldiers. Scrumptious surprises him further with an offer to buy the Toot Sweet as a canine confection and, realising that he is soon to become wealthy, rushes off to propose to Truly. As they drive off together in Chitty, the car takes to the air again, this time without wings.',\n",

On leave in the town, an Arizona man, Sergeant First Class Matt Dyson , encounters Jean Moreton  while out to the cinema. She is the fiancée of a British soldier fighting overseas, and initially rebuffs his advances. He is quite persistent, and she was having her doubts about her relationship with her fiancé anyway. The handsome, brash American sergeant is in stark contrast to the restrained Englishmen she has known. Soon, she is keeping company with Matt, though it is largely platonic at first. For her part, Helen  is a bit more worldly in her affairs. Captain John  comes to her estate often, and a relationship develops.

Eventually, the kind-hearted Matt Dyson is accepted by the Moreton family, though she is engaged to an English lad.

       "  'The film is set in late 1980s Moscow. Standing right in the city centre on Kalinin Prospekt, a barefoot man dressed in a tattered coat appeals to anyone with a strange request: \"Tell me the number of your planet in the tenture? Or least the number of your galaxy in the spiral?\". Random passers-by, two Soviet citizens previously unknown to each other (\"Uncle Vova\", a gruff construction foreman from Moscow Vladimir Mashkov, and \"The Fiddler\", a student from [[Georgia , start a conversation with him, during which the stranger shows them the alien teleportation device - \"traveller\". The foreman Mashkov holds out his hand to the device and, despite the stranger\\'s warnings, clicks on a randomly-selected toolbar button. Suddenly the \"Uncle Vova\" and \"Fiddler\" find themselves alone on the desert planet \"Pluke\" in the \"Kin-dza-dza\" galaxy. From that point on, the movie describes their long quest to find a way back home. The natives of the planet appear human, with deceptively primitive-looking technology and a barbaric culture, which satirically resembles that of humans. They are telepathic; the only spoken words normally used in their culture are “ku”  and “kyu” , the latter being a swear word. However, the Plukanians are able to quickly adapt to understand and speak Russian . The society of Pluke is divided into two categories: Chatlanians and Patsaks. Chatlanians are privileged, and a system of rituals must be followed by the Patsaks to show flattery. The basis of their difference is unexplainable , and for all practical matters they are distinguished with aid of a small handheld device . It is also noted that the social differences between Patsaks and Chatlanians are not constant: Pluke being a Chatlanian planet, they are privileged there; but there are Patsak planets where Patsaks hold the upper hand and Chatlanians are subservient. Wef and Bi switch their social roles immediately and without any problems when visiting one such planet. The only group empowered to use weapons  and enforce their will is the ecilops . The nominal leader of the Plukanian society is named PG; everybody makes their best to display fervent worship to him and disrespect is severely punished; but, when encountered in person, PG appears harmless and dumb. The fuel of Pluke is called lutz and is made from water. All naturally present water has apparently been processed into lutz, so drinking water is a valuable commodity . A good deal of the plot is based on the fact that ordinary wooden matchsticks   are considered to be extremely valuable on Pluke. After finally returning to Earth, Mashkov and Gedevan are going through the same thing as in the beginning, but none of them remember what happened. They are standing at the same place that they first met, and a passing tractor with an orange flashing light reminds them the ecilops. They both reflexively squat and say, \"ku!\". Afterwards, they still recognize each other. The \"Uncle Vova\" looks at the sky, from which came the sound of a song performed by Wef and Bi.',\n",

       "  'The film begins with scenes of life in Wyoming Territory, where new settlers join the cattle business by finding stray, unbranded cattle, called \"mavericks\", on public land. The narrator explains that established ranchers use the so-called \"maverick law\" against the settlers, while \"sharp-witted men\" take advantage of the resulting conflict. After this introduction, Jim Averell  is shown exhorting settlers to elect him governor to defend them against cattle barons such as Reece Duncan . When Averell\\'s speech is over, the famous stage performer Kate Maxwell  arrives with a group of showgirls. Averell has arranged for Kate to operate both a cattle-buying business and a saloon. Duncan warns Kate that he will kill anyone caught stealing cattle on his land, and Sheriff Stan Blaine  warns her of an impending war over the cattle business. The tension between Duncan and the settlers rises as the settlers search for mavericks on Duncan\\'s land and outlaws hired by Averell steal Duncan\\'s cattle. Averell designed the \"K-M\" brand for Kate\\'s cattle business in such a way that her branding iron completely covers Duncan\\'s \"bar double check\" brand when applied directly over it. When Averell explains this trick to Kate, he makes it clear to her that she will be hanged as a rustler if she informs the authorities, and Duncan refuses her offer to support him against Averell. Meanwhile, unknown gunfighters assemble in the nearby hills, and one of them shoots a settler. After Duncan attempts to stop a cattle roundup organized by Averell and the settlers, one of his men is killed, with Kate\\'s branding iron left near the body. To further increase the tension, Averell offers Duncan his support against the settlers immediately after inciting their anger against Duncan. Averell\\'s plan is to ignite a cattle war and promote his own political career by providing leadership once the war has begun. However, Blaine discovers Averell\\'s plan. After Blaine and Kate have explained it to their men, they stage a fake war, and Blaine forces Averell to signal his men. When the outlaws ride into town, they begin a gunfight against both Duncan\\'s men and the settlers. After Averell shoots Blaine, Kate catches him stealing money from the saloon, and when he tries to shoot her, she and Blaine kill him. After the fight, Blaine prepares to leave town, but Kate persuades him to stay with her. The film ends as they ride away to inspect some farmland for a new home.',\n",

Just as they leave the town, Sabata  rides in. Outside the town saloon, Carrincha has been tossed into the street for not having any money. Seeing his friend Alley Cat, Carrincha yells at him, and starts to rant about how dull civilian life is, then seeing Sabata , continues about how his Civil War medal couldn\\'t even be traded for a bottle of whiskey. Sabata, sympathetic, takes out a silver dollar and tosses it into Carrincha\\'s hand. Carrincha happily re-enters the saloon and buys a drink. Sabata enters the saloon, and notices that an old man is being cheated out of his money in a dice game. Drawing his pistol, he blows apart the dice, saying that they are loaded. A man, eating dinner across the saloon starts to stand up, but Sabata aims at him and orders him to sit down. Turning back to the dice game, Sabata reaches into his pocket and pulls out a pair of non loaded dice, which he uses to win the old man his money back. The man whom Sabata ordered to sit down starts to surreptitiously draw a gun, but Sabata quick-draws and blasts out the front legs of the chair which the man was sitting on, causing him to fall face first into his food. At that moment, Banjo starts to play a melody on his banjo. The man screams at him to stop, and Banjo complies, saying  that he thought the man liked music with his supper. Carrincha starts to boast that he once saw Sabata kill twenty men in ten seconds on a pitch black night. A mortally wounded bank guard bursts into the saloon, tells everyone the bank\\'s been robbed, and dies. Everyone panics, running to the bank. The local military commander will have to be told, and posse formed in the morning. The robbers  are riding away from the town, when they notice Sabata is standing in their path, 6-700 yards ahead of them. Aiming a rifle at the robbers, Sabata yells at them to go back to the town. One of the robbers turns to a friend and says \"There isn\\'t a Winchester going that can shoot half that distance.\" before being shot and killed by Sabata. Sabata uses his rifle to kill six more robbers. He takes the wagon back to town. In the morning, just as the military and posse are planning how to go about the manhunt, Sabata rolls in with the safe and the bodies of the robbers. Carrincha is impressed that Sabata killed seven people, but is dismayed that he accepted a lousy 5,000 dollars when he could have taken the entire 100,000 from the safe. Sabata replies that although it is lousy, it\\'s legal. Later, Sabata walks into the town\\'s hotel and rents a room, tossing a coin onto the front desk. He encounters Banjo, whom he apparently knows. Banjo says that he can barely recognize Sabata, because he returned the safe. While this occurs, Stengel discusses the robbery with Ferguson and O\\'Hara. O\\'Hara is scared that the dead robbers will be linked to them. He accuses Stengel of foolishness, revealing that the reason Stengel engineered the robbery was to get money to buy land, which will vastly increase in value when the railroad has to pay him for permission to lay tracks over it. O\\'Hara continues by saying that he is leaving the town for good. Stengel points his dart gun  at O\\'Hara and threatens to kill him if he leaves town. After O\\'Hara leaves, Stengel tells Ferguson that he sent his top henchman, Oswald, and some men to take care of the Virginia Brothers, who can be witnesses against him. Oswald meets with the Virginia Brothers at their hideout so that he can pay them. However this a ruse, Oswald and his men double-crosses the Virginia Brothers and kills them. One of Oswald\\'s underlings ask him what they should do about the Virginia Brothers\\' wagon, which was still in the town. Oswald said that he sent three men to take care of it. In the town, Sabata is talking with Carrincha. He has deduced that acrobats were involved in the robbery . The only acrobats in town are the Virginia Brothers, and they have mysteriously disappeared, leaving their wagon behind. As they discuss it, the three men come into town and start to leave with the wagon. Realizing that they are involved, Sabata yells at them to get away from the wagon. They resist, and Sabata kills them. Carrincha recognizes them as Stengel\\'s men, which makes it all clear to Sabata. Later that night, Oswald returns to Stengel\\'s ranch  to tell him that the job is done. They meet in the Stengel\\'s main room, which is a large room decorated with historical items. On both sides of the room, there are metal shields shaped to look like people, except with a hole where the heart should be. Stengel, after being briefed, tells Oswald that now only he can link him to the robbery. Watching Stengel load a dueling pistol, Oswald realizes that he is going to be murdered. Drawing his revolver, Oswald retreats to one of the shields, while Stengel retreats to the other. Oswald fires a couple of rounds into Stengel\\'s shield, but none go into the hole where the heart is. Stengel, on the other hand, fires one shot which goes through Oswald\\'s hole, and into his chest, killing him. Sabata, who had been watching the whole thing, fires a couple of rounds near him and then rides off into the night. Stengel, with a bunch of men, runs off onto his porch. Sabata, hidden in the night, calls out that he has the Virginia Brothers\\' wagon, which is evidence against him, and that if Stengel wants it back, it will cost 10,000 dollars. Stengel tells Sabata that if he comes over, he\\'ll get the money. Sabata has a separate wagon with a record player on it ride into the Stengel ranch unmanned. The record player gives off Sabata\\'s voice prerecorded. Thinking that Sabata is in the wagon, Stengel and his men fire into it. However, the only thing inside is dynamite. When the wagon explodes, Sabata, still hidden in the night, calls out to Stengel and says that now the price is 20,000 dollars. Sabata returns to the town and sits out on a porch, acting like he was there the entire time. Banjo comes out and commends Sabata on giving Stengel a run for his money. Sabata claims that he hasn\\'t moved from his spot the whole night. Banjo replies that then he\\'d better keep his horse tied up, lest anyone think otherwise. The next day, Banjo tells Sabata  that he has learned that Stengel has no intention of paying the 20,000. Not long after Banjo\\'s visit, four gunman raid Sabata\\'s room. They fire at Sabata\\'s reflection in a mirror. Sabata guns down three of the killers, then hunts down the fourth but allows him to live. Sabata tells Stengel that the price now is 30,000 dollars. Stengel tells Ferguson that Sabata will never stop blackmailing them now, and that they need an outsider. Ferguson then hires a hitman named Sharky . In the saloon, Carrincha is attempting to pawn off his Civil War medal to Banjo, who won\\'t take it . Two more hitmen enter the saloon. While one holds the saloon patrons captive, the other goes up into Sabata\\'s room. Sabata kills the first hitman, and the second is killed by Carrincha, for having called him a \"lice-breeder\". The town\\'s Catholic priest, Father Brown, has Sabata meet him to discuss his recent killing spree. When Sabata arrives, he meets an assassin disguised as Brown who has been hired by Stengel. During their conversation, he attempts to surreptitiously draw a gun hidden in a handkerchief. He stops, however, when Sabata offers him a bag of money in donation. When the paid killer pulls the bag away, a string connecting Sabata\\'s hand to the trigger of Sabata\\'s gun  pulls tight. The gun goes off, killing the would-be assassin. Sabata promptly get Stengel and tells him that now the price is 60,000 dollars. Stengel tells him that he\\'ll have it tomorrow. As Sabata walks away, Stengel desperately aims a rifle at Sabata\\'s back, but stops when he notices that Banjo is watching him across the street. Five men from Denver come into town looking for Banjo, who kills them with a rifle concealed in his banjo. The next day, at the meeting place, Banjo attempts to kill Sabata, but Sabata shoots the rifle out of Banjo\\'s hands. He demands to know how much Banjo was paid, and when Banjo doesn\\'t answer, he fires three warning shots. Thinking that Sabata is out of bullets, Banjo dives for his rifle, which Sabata shoots away with a barrel hidden in the grip of his pistol. Sabata asks how much Banjo will get for killing him. Banjo replies he was offered $100,000, the total amount of theft. Then he orders him to go. Ferguson, who watched the situation, also leaves. Later, Stengel gives Banjo another chance to kill Sabata, warning him not to fail this time. Sabata suddenly appears, and Stengel immediately orders his men to pursue. The men follow Sabata through a canyon pass, who after reaching cover removes his costume, revealing he is in fact Alley Cat in Sabata\\'s trademark black wardrobe. Alley Cat is propelled above the pass when Sabata shoots a bag of rocks that land on a prepared trampoline where Alley Cat stands on. The Stengel’s men are ambushed by Carrincha and Sabata. Triggering dynamite explosions, cause a landslide of rocks that trap Stengel\\'s minions down the canyon pass, without any possibility of escape. After that, Sabata, Carrincha, and Alley Cat prepare to raid the Stengel’s ranch, using dynamite placed in strategic locations. During this operation, one of Stengel\\'s men is killed and placed in a position to make it appear he has fallen asleep, which keeps the others from raising an alarm while Sabata, Carrincha, and Alley Cat work to lay their traps. When the attack begins, Stengel runs inside his fort with his remaining men. Judge O\\'Hara, who has long harbored doubts about Stengel\\'s strategy, sees that the battle may be lost and leaves the ranch. Sabata and his friends enjoy the advantage of complete surprise. Many men are shot dead by Sabata and Carrincha, or killed by dynamite thrown by Alley Cat while they attempt to hold Sabata and Carrincha off with a Gatling gun. Stengel and his few remaining followers take refuge in the house. Inside, they are dispatched by Carrincha and Sabata. Ferguson also dies after being shot in the head  Finally, Sabata comes face to face with Stengel, who being in the room where he earlier dispatched Oswald, believes he has the advantage of knowing how to win a duel  Before shooting, Stengel made a mention about the superiority of men, saying that it lies in having the right final card. Sabata says he does not play, and fired a shot to the cane of Stengel. The cane is booby-trapped to fire a poison dart, and it shoots out and penetrates Stengel\\'s chest, killing him. Sabata and his friends go out, apparently victorious. Suddenly Banjo appears and shoots Sabata, grazing his neck. While Sabata rubs his wound, Banjo asks for the 100,000 dollars. Sabata explains it is in the bank, to be paid by Judge O\\'Hara\\'s to save his reputation. They agree to have a duel the next day in the town. Banjo fires before the countoff is over, thus gaining the drop on Sabata. He fires, and Sabata falls, apparently dead. Wordlessly, Carrincha covers his friend, a crestfallen Alley Cat by his side. Banjo receives the reward and takes the corpse of Sabata, saying he will take charge of its burial. Banjo leads the wagon on the outskirts of town, where he attempts to dump the wagon and ride away with the money. But the bag is shot from his hand by Sabata, who has faked his death, rising from the wagon with rifle in hand. As Carrincha and Alley Cat ride up behind the wagon, Sabata tells Banjo he will lose most of the money and settle the reward in half with Carrincha. Sabata proceeds to load the money bag on his horse, but not before giving a good amount for Carrincha. Then, with an apparent second thought, he leaves a wad of money behind for Banjo. As Banjo stoops to pick it up, Sabata shoots the wad, scattering the bills into a sudden gust of wind and tells Banjo \"You\\'ll have to work for it,\" Banjo chases after the flittering paper, catching a few as the wind carries most of rest into a nearby stream. Carrincha asks: \"Hey friend, who the hell are you?\" With a laugh, Sabata replies: \"Didn\\'t I ever mention it?\" as he rides away. Carrincha offers Alley Cat a stray bill, but Alley Cat refuses. Carrincha then takes a large share of his own haul and hands them to Alley Cat, who stuffs the money into his vest with a smile. Carrincha says they are still partners. Sabata rides away in search of new adventures.',\n",

       "  'The voice of Archie Goodwin  introduces us to the seventh-of-a-ton master sleuth Nero Wolfe  — \"a man who thinks he\\'s the world\\'s greatest detective. Truth being, he is.\" Wolfe lives in an opulent Manhattan brownstone on West 35th Street, where he enjoys reading, the cultivation of rare orchids, beer, and fine food prepared by his resident chef, Fritz Brenner (Colin Fox. The brownstone is also home to Archie, Wolfe\\'s confidential assistant and legman, whose responsibilities include goading his sedentary boss into working occasionally to replenish the coffers. When Archie joins him in the dining room, Wolfe is unfazed by the news that he is overdrawn at the bank — but he is taken aback at the discovery that Fritz has altered one of his favorite dishes without consulting him. The resulting tantrum prompts Archie to do something uncharacteristic when the doorbell rings: admit one of the neighborhood kids, Pete Drossos ([[Robert Clark , who says he has to see Nero Wolfe. Pete has a case. He tells Wolfe he works the wipe racket — cleaning the windshields of cars stopped at intersections, for the occasional tip. About an hour before, Pete saw a good-looking woman wearing large gold earrings shaped like spiders, at the wheel of a 1952 Cadillac. As Pete wiped her windshield the woman mouthed the words, \"Help. Get a cop.\" A male passenger stuck a gun in her ribs and the car drove off. Pete wrote down the license number. If the woman is found dead, Pete believes he can claim a reward by identifying the man who was with her. Since the case is too big for him to handle alone, Pete asks Nero Wolfe to go 50-50. Wolfe instructs Archie to call the police, to suggest they do a routine check on the license plate number, and Pete hurries home to his mother. The next evening Sergeant Purley Stebbins  of Manhattan Homicide visits Wolfe\\'s office. The car Archie had called the police about the previous evening has just been seen to run down and kill a boy — a boy named Peter Drossos. Stebbins\\' visit is interrupted by the arrival of Pete\\'s mother , who is there to do what her dying boy asked her to do: \"Go to Mr. Wolfe. Tell him what happened. Give Mr. Wolfe the money. Tell him to find the guy who ran me down.\" After Mrs. Drossos leaves, Wolfe tells Archie to return Pete\\'s money — $4.30 — or give it to the Red Cross. Archie refuses and instead drafts a newspaper ad directed at the woman Pete saw at the wheel of the Cadillac. Archie is sure the ad will never be answered, but it will give Wolfe the feeling that he has earned his fee. But the ad does draw Inspector Cramer  of Manhattan Homicide, who wants to know what Wolfe is up to. The Cadillac has been found, along with evidence that it was used for another murder: that of an Immigration and Naturalization Service agent named Matthew Birch. The ad then attracts a woman reluctant to give her name — and she is wearing golden spider earrings. She offers $500 for information about the boy who saw her driving the car. After Wolfe explains that the boy is dead and the police are searching for the driver, the woman is shaken. She identifies herself as Laura Fromm , a wealthy widow and philanthropist. She admits she was not driving the car, presents Wolfe with a $10,000 retainer for his expert advice, and promises to return the next day. First she must see someone, find out something. Wolfe accepts the retainer and warns Mrs. Fromm sternly about the danger of asking any questions herself, since two people have already been killed. Mrs. Fromm is not on time for her appointment the next day. Instead, Wolfe is visited by two attorneys who report that Mrs. Fromm has been run down and killed by a car. One is executor of her estate; the other is Dennis Horan , an attorney for the Association of European Refugees, a humanitarian organization with which Mrs. Fromm was closely involved. When asked to return the hefty retainer, Wolfe tells the lawyers that he intends to earn the money by finding the murderer. Freelance operatives Saul Panzer , Orrie Cather  and Fred Durkin  are called in to assist — to investigate the refugee organization, trace the distinctive golden spider earrings, and see if anything comes of Wolfe\\'s conjecture that Matthew Birch was the passenger in the Cadillac. The inquiry reveals a blackmail ring that is victimizing hundreds of vulnerable people. In the final scene, Archie meets with Pete\\'s mother in the office and gives her half of Laura Fromm\\'s $10,000 retainer, saying that Pete and Wolfe had agreed to take equal shares of any proceeds from the case. Even though she begins to cry — something Wolfe cannot bear — Archie reports to Wolfe that she kept her composure until she made it out the door.',\n",
       "  'Jennie Logan and her husband Michael ([[Alan Feinstein  are trying to salvage their marriage after Jennie finds out about Michael\\'s infidelity. They move into an old Victorian house in rural New England. In the attic, Jennie, who is herself a Victorian at heart, finds an authentic Victorian white dress under a protective cover, thick with dust. The dress is intact save for one small tear in shoulder of the fabric. After having the dress repaired, Jennie decides to wear it and admires herself in the mirror in the attic. She begins experiencing excruciating headaches and the room starts swirling around her. When the headache ceases, she finds herself still up in the attic, in the dress, yet the attic is now an artist\\'s studio, complete with Victorian artifacts. Upon hearing muffled sounds from below, she hears a woman scream, as a man\\'s voice downstairs is yelling, \"Pamela.\" Terrified, Jennie shuts her eyes and finds herself back in the spot she was, in the present. At first she assumes she is either dreaming or hallucinating, yet Jennie experiences further similar episodes. She is initially terrified of finding herself in an unfamiliar situation and hysterical once she is pulled back into the present. After experiencing this a couple of times, she decides to explore the history of her new house in more detail. She goes to the local historical museum where an old curator named Mrs Bates  explains to her that the house belonged to artist David Reynolds in the year 1899. She explains how David reports that he saw the ghost of his dead wife several times and called out to her, but she disappeared each time. Reynolds died under mysterious circumstances on the night of the turn of the century. Legend has it that either he was murdered during a duel or that it was the woman he loved who killed him. However, no-one knows for certain. Also on the wall of the museum is a portrait painting which the old woman mistakes for Reynold\\'s dead wife Pamela. Mrs Bates remarks how much of a striking resemblance the portrait bears to Jennie. Intrigued by this, Jennie keeps going back and forth between the two worlds by wearing the antique dress to meet David, who is grieving for his dead bride Pamela. When David first sees her again, he mistakes her for Pamela but quickly realises that it isn\\'t her after Jennie introduces herself. Jennie realizes that what David mistook for his wife\\'s ghostly appearances were really Jennie appearing in and out of time. When Jennie confides in her husband Michael, he doesn\\'t believe her when she reveals to him about her time travels, and thinks that she is going crazy. He urges her to go a psychiatrist named Dr Erica Lauren .

However, she is unable to shed any light on the situation. Jennie and David fall in love in 1899, but David\\'s sister-in-law Elizabeth Harrington  is also in love with him. However, her father  disapproves of David and blames him for Pamela\\'s accidental death. During their time together, David reveals to Jennie that he is working on a portrait. It is the same one that Jennie saw in the museum in the present which she assumed to be David\\'s late wife Pamela. The painting is in fact a portrait of Jennie, which explains why it resembles her so closely. Pamela\\'s father later challenges David to a duel on the night of the turn of the century - the night that David died. In the present, Jennie tries to find out how she can prevent David\\'s death and save his life. Michael still doesn\\'t believe Jennie. He gives her a locket which she promises she will always wear. Mrs Bates later calls Jennie and says that \"Aunt Betty\" is dying and wants to make a death bed confession. \"Aunt Betty\" reveals that she is really Elizabeth Harrington and that she is actually responsible for David\\'s murder. During the duel, Elizabeth was hiding with a gun which she used to shoot David. Jennie rushes to save David in the past, but she is confronted by Michael who suspects her of inventing the entire delusion and that she is really having an affair. He tries to prevent her from going up to the attic, in the process ripping the shoulder of Jennie\\'s dress and bringing it back to the state in which it was originally found. He chases her up the stairs but she manages to block his path by locking the door, which he tries to break down. In the meantime, Jennie has already escaped from the present world to the past world to stop the duel and try to save David\\'s life. Jennie spots Elizabeth but appears to be shot when she tries to prevent the murder. In the present, Michael manages to break into the attic but he is too late. He discovers the lifeless body of Jennie lying on the bed. He grieves her death and she is later buried. Later, as Michael is cleaning out the attic, and preparing to move, the movers stumble onto several paintings. He goes through them, only to find out that they are of his wife, from the time she had left to be in the past and showing the life she led there: her portrait from the wedding to David, to a trip to Paris and to her growing old. While looking at these pictures, he notices that she is wearing the locket he gave her in the paintings. He remembers everything Jenny had said, and begins to cry, finally realizing that his wife was right the entire time. He then goes to the local cemetery, and finds the grave of \"Jennie Reynolds\" and lays flowers, before walking away.',\n",

       "  'In 1943, a WREN  and an RAF pilot  meet at an auction of Rohan family heirlooms, now all being sold off after the last of the Rohan male line was killed at Dunkirk. After the RAF pilot inadvertently casts aspersions on the Rohan family, the WREN reveals that the last male Rohan was in fact her brother. The RAF man apologises, and reveals that his family are connected to the Rohans in a way, and so they arrange to meet for lunch and at the auction the following day. Back in the Regency period, a new teacher arrives at Miss Patchett\\'s school for young ladies at Bath. This is Hesther , whose family in Manchester has fallen on hard times and are being done a favor by Miss Patchett. She, however, resents living off charity and so she soon afterwards comes into friction with Clarissa , a minor heiress who is a pupil at the school. In time, Clarissa and Hesther patch up their differences and become friends, soon before Hesther runs away with Barbary, a penniless ensign. Miss Patchett forbids the disgraced name of Hesther to be mentioned at the school as a result and so Clarissa, out of loyalty to her friend, leaves the school. In London, Clarissa\\'s godmother arranges for her to meet the eponymous man in grey , Lord Rohan , a notorious rake, misanthrope and duelist with a huge fortune. He marries her, though neither of them does so out of love - she does so to please her godmother, and he to gain an heir to the Rohan line - and they live separate lives. Clarissa sees an advertisement for a production of Othello in Saint Albans featuring a \"Mrs Barbary,\" whom she rightly takes to be Hesther under her married name. On the way there in her coach, she is waylaid by a mysterious man  who hitches a ride with them to St Albans and turns out to be Rokeby, the actor playing Othello. Hesther is invited to supper after the play by Clarissa, and tells her that Ensign Barbary died in her arms some time past, leaving her penniless. Clarissa promises to get her a position as her son\\'s governess and, though Lord Rohan refuses to grant this position, he does allow Hesther to stay on as Clarissa\\'s companion. Shortly afterwards, when Rohan and Hesther are together, he reveals that he knows she has deceived Clarissa - Hesther in fact left her dissolute husband soon after marrying him, and he had in fact then died in the Fleet Prison - out of ruthless ambition. Rohan admires this and the two begin an affair. Attending horse-racing at Epsom Downs, Clarissa and Rokeby meet again and fall further in love. Hesther gets Rohan to give Rokeby a job on his country estate so as to draw Rokeby and Clarissa away from London and, though Rokeby warns Hesther that he knows what she is trying to do, the ploy succeeds. Later, Rokeby and Clarissa return to London separately and then attempt to elope together to recover his estates in Jamaica , but Rohan stops them and a duel between him and Rokeby ensues in the Vauxhall Gardens, which is broken up by the Prince Regent. Mrs Fitzherbert convinces Rokeby to embark alone, and wait for Rohan to be convinced into a separation, but Clarissa pursues him to the port to say farewell. In staying out in the rain watching his ship sail away, she catches a fever and, worse still, is taken back to Lord Rohan\\'s London house and not to the place of safety Rokeby had promised. The fever is not necessarily fatal but Hesther - putting Clarissa into a drugged sleep, opening the windows and dousing the fire in her room - ensures that it proves so, so clearing the way for herself to marry Rohan. Shortly after the funeral, Hesther manages to get Rohan to offer her marriage but then Clarissa\\'s page boy Toby reveals Hesther\\'s murder to Rohan. Though he did not love his wife, she was still his wife and a Rohan, and so he beats Hesther to death - for, as his family motto goes, \"Who Dishonours Us, Dies.\" Back in 1943, it is revealed that the RAF man was the descendent of Rokeby. He and Miss Rohan arrive just too late to buy the item they were looking to purchase at the auction, but they do not mind as they have found each other and fallen in love. They then rush for a London bus, with their love-affair seeming better-fated than that of their ancestors.',\n",

The Elite Hunting representatives try to find someone to finish with Whitney, inquiring whether an Italian cannibal  who is eating Miroslav alive and a man who has his victim chained to an electrified metal bed are interested.

Jeremiah gravely contributes to this situation, as he blows the little money Janet makes on alcohol and horse races. Al has to work part-time in an antique shop to support his family as best he can. One day, Al\\'s boss brings an old lamp, which a fisherman acquaintance of his has just salvaged from the ocean, to the store and orders Al to polish it. As Al rubs on the lamp, a genie - the very one from Aladdin\\'s tale - suddenly appears before him and proclaims him his new master. After recovering from his first shock, Al begins to use the genie\\'s power to fulfill some of his most eager wishes: beating up a bully and his gang, winning the affection of Patricia, his long-time crush, and riding in a real Rolls Royce, something his late father had always dreamed of. More importantly, Al begins to view the Genie as a friend and asks him only for his most fondest wishes without overindulging himself. The presence of the Genie and his powers, however, gradually begin to draw in trouble. Patricia\\'s father, Sergeant O\\'Connor, begins to take an unwelcome interest in the brand-new Rolls Royce cars Al suddenly begins to get out of nowhere; the Genie interferes with Siracusa\\'s illicit business, which frustrates the mobster to no end, and is arrested twice for driving without a license, which earns him two temporary stints in prison . In addition, his powers only work during the day, as they have to regenerate overnight, which proves a bit problematic at times, such as when Al is kidnapped by a band of child snatchers and has to wait come morning before the Genie can overcome the gangsters. In due time, the Chief of the Police learns of the Genie\\'s mysterious abilities and orders his superintendent to bring the Genie to him. Eventually, Siracusa abducts Janet and Jeremiah and begins to brutally question them about the Genie. Although it is night when Al summons him, the Genie\\'s physical strength proves more than enough to finish Siracusa\\'s gang by himself, and the gangsters are arrested. Under a false pretense, the Genie is taken away to be dissected, but Al, fearing the worst, finds him before this deed can be executed and manages to convince the Police Chief that he is not an alien but a real-life genie. The Chief then asks Al to have the Genie disable the entire world\\'s military arsenal - all except of his own private army, so that he can seize control over the world. The Genie, however, refuses to fulfill this wish, as it would seriously upset the balance of power, and he and Al make their escape on the Chief\\'s office carpet converted into a flying carpet. The pair proceeds to the Bermuda Triangle, where the Genie prepares to sink the lamp into the depths of the sea to prevent his powers from being abused. Al, however, unwilling to let his friend go, asks for one final wish, which is fulfilled. With the reward money from Siracusa\\'s capture, the Haddins buy the nightclub and celebrate its reopening, with the Genie staying with them as a normal human being.',\n",
       "  'Will Stockdale is a backward, backwoods rube from outside Callville, Georgia who may or may not be smarter than he looks. Accused by Mr. McKinney the head of the draft board of being a draft dodger, it turns out that Stockdale\\'s draft notices have been hidden from him by his father, who doesn\\'t want the boy to leave home and be ridiculed. His father tells Will to be careful going to big cities like Macon and Atlanta. Pa Stockdale says he has been to those cities many years before and he was ridiculed. Wrongfully shackled by McKinney, Stockdale joins a group of new United States Air Force draftees being transported to basic training. They include the obnoxious bully Irving S. Blanchard, who having undergone ROTC training, volunteers to be in charge.  They report to boot camp, where Stockdale and his equally dim, but smarter friend, Ben Whitledge, begin the struggle to join the infantry. Stockdale is incredibly strong and can drink any man under the table. He proceeds to make life miserable for the man in charge, Master Sergeant Orville C. King, who likes his barracks to be quiet and calm. King wears Air Crewmember Wings and states, \"he is 45 years old, has eighteen years in the military service and sixteen years as a sergeant.\" In exasperation, the sergeant places the country bumpkin on full-time latrine duty. Stockdale believes his new position of \"P.L.O.\"  to be a promotion. The happy-go-lucky Stockdale feels that King must be \"the best dang sergeant in whole dang US Air Force.\" The totally unhappy Whitledge wants no part of it, lamenting that an \"Airman\" is \"like something from a funny book.\" Ben wants to be assigned to the infantry instead. A letter from his mother states, \"that Ben\\'s six brothers have all served in the Infantry.\" Ben tells Will, \"his grandfather was a Confederate Infantryman, under General Stonewall Jackson at the Battle of Chancellorsville.\" Ben Whitledge says, \"In the War Between the States, it was the infantry that did the fighting,\" which is understandable, airplanes not having been invented yet. King tells Will the Captain desires to see the barracks and latrine spotless. A company inspection takes a surprising turn when Stockdale\\'s immaculately clean latrine is what impresses King\\'s company commander most. King gets into hot water, however, when Stockdale opens his big mouth and reveals that the sergeant kept him on bathroom duty on a permanent basis while also neglecting to have the recruit complete all the required military exams and paper work. The company commander orders King to have Stockdale through his training in one week, or else he will not only be demoted, but be made \"Permanent Latrine Orderly\" himself. Rushing him through testing, King bribes Stockdale by promising to give him his wristwatch, if he can pass. Stockdale flummoxes and frustrates the various officer and men, he takes a manual dexterity test conducted by Corporal John C. Brown , a psychiatric test by Maj. Royal B. Demming , and an eye exam, amazingly managing to get by after driving them all crazy. Stockdale gets the wristwatch as a reward. Ben comes to attention when a WAF Captain speaks, Will is speechless. Later, she is escorted into the Enlisted Men\\'s Mess Hall by the Colonel. After being informed of military etiquette as to female officers by Ben, when Blanchard and King ask Will what he sees he says, \"a Captain.\" Private Blanchard tells M/Sgt. King to get three passes to go to a local bar, \"The Purple Grotto\" where King and Blanchard try to get Stockdale drunk in order to make him look bad and King look good. He admits he has never drunk...store bought liquor. King and Blanchard are inebriated, but Will is still sober. Stockdale says the only alcohol he previously had was what his father made with corn, grain and kerosene. Blanchard buys Lighter Fluid from a cigarette girl. Mixing gin and bourbon with kerosene ... Will drinks it and says \"it\\'s familiar.\" Then a drunken Army infantryman walks by and a barroom brawl begins. Stockdale leaves behind a fighting Blanchard and King; as he walks past the Air Police, he tells them that upstairs is the bar. The colonel and captain later inspect the latrine and barracks. Will has mechanically rigged all the toilet seats to open simultaneously in a \"salute\". While Blanchard is arrested and detained by the Air Police, M/Sgt. King is found filthy in a torn uniform, later in the latrine, and is summarily reduced to private rank, while Whitledge was blamed for King\\'s appearance and is also placed in disgraced status. As King goes back to his office dejected, he admits to Stockdale that he and Blanchard had been trying to trick Stockdale to get him out of the way so that King would not look bad, but their effort backfired. Will gives the watch back to King. King also admits he had grown to like Stockdale and became his reluctant and inadvertent mentor to success in the Air Force. Will, Ben and Pvt. King are sent to Gunnery School. Will is at the bottom of the class and Ben is next to the bottom. King graduates as the top man of the class. He is assigned to General Eugene Bush\\'s staff and is given back his M/Sgt. rank. The story ends with Stockdale and Whitledge  flying to Denver in an obsolete B-25 medium bomber. Stockdale\\'s assignment is tail gunner on the bomber. After putting the plane on Autopilot, the lazy pilots fall asleep, and the airplane soon becomes lost at night over what the navigator thinks is the Gulf of Mexico. They really are flying over the Atomic Bomb Test Site at Yucca Flats, Nevada, during an A-bomb test called \"Operation Prometheus\". The radio operator of the plane was left behind at the base, so Stockdale and Whitledge must radio to obtain their real position; however, the radio is inoperatable. Stockdale remembers that back home in Georgia, his father would spit into the radio and smack it to make it work. Stockdale repeats the method, and the radio works. Military radiomen on the ground, confused by Stockdale\\'s folksy, clownish speech, have the commander of the test Maj. Gen. Vernon Pollard, U.S. Army Infantry frantically rouse Maj. Gen. Eugene Bush, U.S. Air Force from his sleep to confirm that Stockdale is not a prankster, and to give Stockdale emergency flying instructions. Bush reassures Stockdale that he is real and not a foreign agent as King tells Bush to remind Stockdale of the watch. Meanwhile, a fire breaks out in the aft of the plane. The Air Force and Army are put on full alert. Stockdale and Whitledge bail out of the plane just before it crashes, and are declared dead by the Staff Aide M/Sgt. King. During an Air Medal ceremony honoring them as fallen heroes, they reappear, and the Air Force has to cover up that the pair are alive to avoid an international public humiliation. Stockdale suggests both he and Ben  be transferred to become infantrymen. Will and Ben are taken at night to a secluded area. An agreement is reached by two former West Point classmates, General Pollard, USA and General Bush, USAF, who also heartily approve of Stockdale\\'s last request—to have M/Sgt. King transferred with them to the infantry. General Pollard has to cut an Air Medal from his uniform. He sits as General Bush pins the Air Medal on Ben Whitledge. As a radio station signs off, to The Star-Spangled Banner, all the men snap to attention, including a reluctant General Pollard.',\n",

His bright but naive and idealistic son, Robert , works as a linguist at GCHQ a top secret British intelligence agency, using his love of Russian to listen to various pieces of communication on the other side of the Iron Curtain. The film opens on Remembrance Day in Whitehall, as the war veterans line up to walk past the Cenotaph, then moves back to a conversation between Jones and his son at Robert\\'s flat some months earlier, where Robert tells Jones that strange things are happening at GCHQ, and he\\'s planning on leaving and marrying an older woman called Cynthia  he\\'s fallen in love with. Robert says a Soviet mole was found, and that security is all over the place encouraging people to rat on each other. The higher ups seem convinced that if they don\\'t do something, their American friends in the CIA will stop working with them.

It\\'s obvious that Jones loves his son deeply and wants him to be happy, whatever he may choose for himself.

The rest of the movie digs into an examination of the British establishment which is disturbing and ugly, and make Jones question his view of the country he loves.

After Pickett is also killed in mysterious circumstances in a traffic accident, having found out the name of the man who Robert wished him to meet and before meeting Jones. Jones is then approached by Robert\\'s best friend and fellow British intelligence linguist Allen Goodburn  at Robert\\'s funeral. Jones gets from Goodburn that it was his good friend Grieg who had approached him as to Robert\\'s feelings for the service. Jones gets Grieg drunk and gets him to confess that he was at Robert\\'s flat the night Robert died. Grirg admits he was there as the service had something on him, but that his job was only to leave the door open and let \"others\" heavy hand Robert, not kill him. Leaving Grieg in his drunken stupor, Jones is picked up by British Intelligence and driven to a country house, where he is confronted by Secretary to the Cabinet  and Lord . They explain to him that his son was out of control, and was killed as part of a plan to mislead the Americans to the extent of the depth of Russian intelligence\\'s operatives inside British operations, in the hope that they could continue to gain intelligence from the CIA. They have presently left the higher Russian operative in place, until they can assess the extent of the damage caused. They advise Jones that should he go public with any of this information, he and/or Robert\\'s girlfriend Cynthia and her daughter will be killed or at least restrained.

Jones asks Chapple to sign a full confession, which he does, but on approaching the desk where Chapple writes, Chapple points a gun at Jones.

       "  \"It covers the life of Charles II - beginning just before his Restoration to the throne in 1660. He was deeply traumatized by the execution of his father in 1649, after the former's defeat in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms; it begins, however, with his penurious exile in Antwerp in 1658. The mini-series' emphasis is on his court, and his conflicts with Parliament - essentially the same issues which led to the Civil War between his father and the House of Commons, the politics of whom would succeed him - and his relationships with his family as well as his mistresses and illegitimate son James, Duke of Monmouth. The mini-series dramatizes both Charles's laziness and frivolous diversion, leaving political issues to his chancellor Sir Edward Hyde, but becoming increasingly irritated by the paternalistic way which Hyde behaves towards him. Dismissing Hyde, he takes the reins of power himself, determined that his brother should succeed him in the event of him not having any legitimate children , and that Royal Power not be challenged by Parliament. The production won the British Academy Television Award for Best Drama Serial in 2004; the series was also nominated for a minor Emmy .\",\n",

Higgins is impressed by the man\\'s honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals - \"Can\\'t afford \\'em!\" claims Doolittle. Higgins recommends Doolittle to a wealthy American who is interested in morality. Eliza goes through many forms of speech training, such as speaking with marbles in her mouth, enduring Higgins\\' harsh approach to teaching and his treatment of her personally. She makes little progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally \"gets it\"; she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper class accent. As a test, Higgins takes her to Ascot Racecourse, where she makes a good impression with her stilted, but genteel manners, only to shock everyone by a sudden and vulgar lapse into Cockney while encouraging a horse to win a race: \"C\\'mon Dover, move your bloomin\\' arse!\" Higgins, who dislikes the pretentiousness of the upper class, partly conceals a grin behind his hand. Eliza poses as a mysterious lady at an embassy ball and even dances with a foreign prince. At the ball is Zoltan Karpathy , a Hungarian phonetics expert trained by Higgins. After a brief conversation with Eliza, he certifies that she is not only Hungarian, but of royal blood. This makes Higgins\\' evening, since he has always looked upon Karpathy as a bounder and a crook. After all the effort she has put in however, Eliza is given hardly any credit, all the praise going to Higgins. This, and his callous treatment towards her afterwards, especially his indifference to her future, causes her to walk out on him, leaving him mystified by her ingratitude. Accompanied by Freddy Eynsford-Hill , a young man she met at Ascot and who has become enamoured of her, Eliza returns to her old stomping ground at Covent Garden, but finds that she no longer fits in. She meets her father, who has been left a large fortune by the wealthy American Higgins had sent him to and is resigned to marrying Eliza\\'s stepmother. Alfred feels that Higgins has ruined him, since he is now bound by morals and responsibility. Eventually, Eliza ends up visiting Higgins\\' mother, who is incensed at her son\\'s behaviour. Higgins finds Eliza the next day and attempts to talk her into coming back to him. During a testy exchange, Higgins becomes incensed when Eliza announces that she is going to marry Freddy and become Karpathy\\'s assistant. Higgins explodes and Eliza is satisfied that she has had her \"own back.\" Higgins has to admit that rather than being \"a millstone around my neck... now you\\'re a tower of strength, a consort battleship. I like you this way.\" Eliza leaves, saying they will never meet again. After an argument with his mother&mdash;in which he asserts that he does not need Eliza or anyone else &mdash; Higgins makes his way home, stubbornly predicting that Eliza will come crawling back. However, he comes to the horrified realization that he has \"grown accustomed to her face.\" Then, to his surprise, Eliza reappears in Higgins\\' study: she knows now that he cares for her after all.',\n",
       "  ' On Thanksgiving Day, 1983, student Marty Pascal ([[Josh Hamilton  brings his fiancée, Lesly , home to his family\\'s McLean, Virginia estate to meet them for the first time. Marty is obviously nervous and hesitant about the impending introduction of his future wife to his family; he has informed them that he is bringing a guest but without any further details. Marty\\'s family prepares both for his arrival and for an impending hurricane. Marty\\'s twin sister Jacqueline , recently released from a psychiatric hospital, is ecstatic about his arrival, until she is informed that a \"friend\" is accompanying Marty. She becomes distressed and, over the course of the night, shows many signs that suggest she suffers from bipolar disorder, including sudden mood swings and an inability to cope with change. Referred to as \"Jackie-O\" by her family, Jackie has had a long obsession with the former first lady and the Kennedy assassination. As an adult, Jackie-O still emulates the former first lady in her style of dress and her hairstyle. Jackie-O lives with her mother and her younger brother Anthony . He and the matriarch of the family, Mrs. Pascal  are very protective of Jackie. Mrs. Pascal is immediately suspicious and guarded against her future daughter-in-law Lesly. Meanwhile, Lesly is initially oblivious to the tumultuous nature of the family. It is clear that Marty is in love with Lesly\\'s \"normalcy\" and their engagement is a way for him to break from his family mold. As the hurricane outside intensifies, Marty and Lesly become stranded in the house until the storm lets up. After meeting Lesly, Jackie-O comes close to a melt-down at her bathroom sink, yet suddenly gains her composure and surprises Lesly. Jackie playfully interrogates Lesly about her love life with Marty, going so far as to ask for graphic details about their sexual escapades. Jackie-O informs Lesly of a nearby former girlfriend of Marty\\'s, with whom he shared an intense affair in his youth and hints that there might be a \"reunion\" between the two former lovers. It becomes clear that Marty\\'s lover was in fact Jackie-O after she coerces Marty into playing their favorite childhood \"game,\" a re-enactment of the JFK assassination, a game that led to their first sexual encounter when they were 14. Jackie-O and Marty play the game, and after she has \"shot\" him, she runs over to cradle him in her arms. She begins to kiss him, and the two have sex. Lesly walks in on them and, horrified, runs back upstairs where Anthony, who previously tried to warn her of Marty and Jackie\\'s sexual relationship, convinces Lesly that he is an insecure virgin dying of a brain tumor, leading to a short and awkward sexual encounter. In the morning, Lesly confronts the family about the events of the night before. Mrs. Pascal coerces Anthony to tell Marty that he slept with Lesly. Meanwhile, Jackie-O searches the house for a gun that Marty had been ordered to hide by their mother, finding it in the bathroom. She flushes Marty\\'s car keys down the toilet and returns to the living room where Lesly confronts Jackie-O about her mental illness and incestuous relationship. As Lesly runs to get their suitcases so she and Marty can leave, Jackie pulls the gun and asks Marty to play their game one last time, agreeing to let them leave afterward. Anthony races to find her medication while Marty cautiously plays along. In tears, Jackie shoots and kills her brother. Lesly runs from the house. In a voice over , Jackie explains that Marty was buried in the backyard \"next to Daddy.\"',\n",

       "  'Sylvester the cat awakes on Christmas morning to find a present for him. To his disappointment, it is merely a rubber mouse. He hears his hated rival Tweety singing Jingle Bells in his cage, which has been gift wrapped and addressed to Granny. Just before she enters the room, he switches the cage\\'s tag so it\\'s addressed \"To Kitty\" instead. Granny innocently gives the cage to Sylvester and opens the box with the rubber mouse. Believing there has been an innocent mix-up, she goes to give Sylvester the mouse and correct the mistake. Upon seeing a satisfied Sylvester hiccup Tweety\\'s feathers, Granny realizes what has occurred and angrily forces Sylvester to regurgitate Tweety. After giving the wayward cat a scolding, Granny insists that Sylvester kiss Tweety under a sprig of mistletoe. Sylvester eats Tweety Bird again instead, and is once again scolded and forced to spit him out. Granny places Tweety\\'s cage up high where Sylvester shouldn\\'t be able to reach him. Undaunted, the ever-resourceful feline retrieves a ladder, climbs up to Tweety\\'s cage, and opens it with the intent to eat him. Tweety Bird manages to convince Sylvester that a huge present waiting under the Christmas tree is for Sylvester. Sylvester abandons Tweety in his greed, and opens the present with relish. It turns out to be Hector the Bulldog, who promptly eats Sylvester. Granny arrives and forces Hector to spit out Sylvester, and then throws the dog out of her house. Sylvester then attempts to get to Tweety by using a toy steam crane. Instead, he catches an angry Granny, who chases and bashes Sylvester with a broom. The feline retreats to the second floor of the house and attempts to saw a hole in the floor so as to be able to descend upon Tweety from above. Tweety replaces himself in the cage with a stick of lit dynamite, which goes off just as Sylvester pulls the cage up to his level. Sylvester then puts the wrecked cage back and stumbles down the stairs, blackened and torn up from the explosion. He next attempts a Western-style showdown with Tweety; himself playing the part of Geronimo, with Tweety playing Hopalong Cassidy. After being shot by a pop-gun , Sylvester wins, but before he can consume his prize, Granny shoots a plunger over his mouth, and declares, \"You didn\\'t count on Pocahontas, did you, Geronimo?\" While Tweety plays on his new train set, Sylvester tries one last time to catch him. He takes some spare train tracks, sets them up to point towards his open mouth, and the puts the train in reverse. The train goes over the new tracks, and towards Sylvester who then devours Tweety, only to be devoured himself by Hector the Bulldog who has somehow gotten back in the house. Granny whacks Hector until he coughs up Sylvester, and then does the same to Sylvester until he coughs up Tweety. Granny announces she\\'s had enough, and that she\\'ll show Sylvester and Hector there will be peace in the house once and for all. The cartoon ends with Granny and Tweety singing a variation of the Christmas carol \"Hark The Herald Angels Sing\". On Tweety\\'s right and left are Sylvester and Hector, both with \"Do Not Open Til Xmas\" stamps over their mouths.',\n",

Bozorboy Normatov discovers the alien while looking for his lost cow \"Oytovoq.\" Sotiboldi writes that the spaceship that crashed in Uzbekistan, \"unlike the beautiful spaceship with lights in E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, looks like a pot but is real.\" The alien is a white boy who speaks many languages and can perform miracles such as transporting people and objects through space and making it rain at will. Bozorboy calls the alien Abdullajon after his grandfather. Bozorboy adopts Abdullajon as his seventh child. The villagers think that Abdullajon is an illegitimate child of Bozorboy from his Russian wife somewhere. Russian scientists in Moscow predict that an alien will land in the village and ask the head of the kolkhoz to tell them immediately if anyone comes across the alien. Bozorboy and Abdullajon look for the tiny gadget that would allow Abdullajon to call for help. Bozorboy finds the gadget first and hides it from Abdullajon but later can\\'t find it in the place where he hides it. When Bozorboy says to Abdullajon that he needs \"big money\" to solve all of his problems, Abdullajon understands him literally and makes him a huge one Ruble coin about the size of a manhole from the family\\'s cauldron. Then Bozorboy asks Abdullajon to multiply a Ruble banknote. Abdullajon easily makes much money from a single banknote. However, after reading in one of the notes that making counterfeit money is illegal, they burn all the money. Abdullajon performs many more miracles such as enabling people to fly on hoes, making hens lay fifty eggs per minute, growing enormous fruits and vegetables , making a cow give birth to forty calves, and enabling a local technician to make his own hi-fi VCR recorders. The villagers do not know that Abdullajon is responsible for all of the miracles. An old drunkard tells the head of the kolkhoz that he will tell everyone in the village that the head is responsible for all the miracles in exchange for getting a bottle of vodka every day. The head agrees and gets all the credit for the miracles. At a public meeting he is presented a special hoe which fails to fly. Bozorboy tells the head of the kolkhoz about Abdullajon. The head asks Abdullajon to make his hoe fly as well but Abdullajon disagrees saying that he is guilty of an \"unforgivable crime\", namely, killing a bee. The head angrliy climbs up to a tall tower with a hoe and falls to the ground and becomes a cripple. Moscow deploys a fleet of tanks and fighter planes to find the alien. It is revealed that Bozorboy\\'s wife hid the device that would enable Abdullajon to call for help. She gives it to Abdullajon and sees him off as he flies away in another pot-like spaceship.

Soon after, his other friend Kid  arrives as well, and they explain the story to him as well. Duca sees Kid touch Isa's shoulder, though, and becomes jealous so he decides to return home. The following day, Duca talks with Isa  again, and his skill for detective work by spotting flaws in her story that she did not spend much time with Kid after Duca left; he does not mention this to her, though, and finds out the truth from Kid later while they are shopping for CDs. As the story develops, Duca continues to try to subtly keep Isa and Kid from getting together due to Isa's obvious attraction to Kid, while simultaneously looking into the murder. To this end, Duca asks permission to visit Eder in jail. Isa eagerly volunteers to go along on the adventure, and they set out the following day. When they meet Eder, he asks Duca to give a message to his lover. Eder asks Duca to tell her not to visit him while he is in jail, and to tell her that he is fine. On the way back, Isa remembers the Pokémon pen that was confiscated from her and they return to the jail to retrieve it. Since they took the bus through a dangerous part of town, they are forced to walk the distance. The two encounter a group of men who aggressively hit on Isa, causing her to run away. The next day at school, she brags about her adventure, embellishing the details greatly to her friends. Duca remains silent, but when pressed for details himself, he disagrees with Isa, and she storms away angrily. Attempting to get past the incident, he pretends it never happened, to the annoyance of Isa. Kid, however, is eager to have an adventure of his own and so agrees to travel to Eder's girlfriend's condo and relay the message. After locating Eder's Lover, Soraya , they are permitted up by the doorman. She answers her door scantily clad, and invites the boys in. They relay the message, to her general disinterest, and she requests that Duca repair her automatic pool cleaning device - a product of Eder's that failed to sell well. Out by her pool, Duca notices several items which lead him to believe another man is living with Soraya. Moving inside, his suspicions are confirmed when he sees a tattooed male arm answering a phone downstairs. While leaving, they accidentally track soil from a broken vase over the carpet downstairs to the fury of the doorman. They flee, giving Kid something to brag about at school the next day as well. Duca again visits his uncle, and this time asks him more questions. He decides that Eder is lying about his involvement and is covering for Soraya, who Duca believes is the true killer. Duca believes that his uncle is taking the fall for a woman who is being unfaithful to Eder and may be simply using Eder. He believes that Eder would never take Duca's word for it about the man living with Soraya, and so he goes about hiring a private investigator to obtain photographic evidence. Meanwhile, during the investigation, Duca is worried that an upcoming party will lead to Isa and Kid getting together at last, so he craftily plays matchmaker with Kid and another classmate. However, upon seeing how unhappy Isa becomes after watching the two dance, Duca helps to repair the situation and leaves the party with his two friends dancing closely together. When the investigator shows the photographs, Duca is surprised to find it showing Kid back at Soraya's condo. The series of pictures seems to suggest that the two had sex, and when Isa asks to see the photographs, Duca refuses to show them, causing yet another fight between the two friends. Duca mails the photographs to Eder, hoping it will convince him to tell the truth to the police, and he remains not on speaking terms with his two friends for nearly a week.

Eder, meanwhile, attacks the man living with his girlfriend and discovers that it is Fabio, Soraya's brother. The man in the pictures, however, is Kid . Soraya explains the series of photographs with an innocent story; but Duca can see that she is lying. As usual, though, he does not mention it to anyone. Eder and his girlfriend make up, and Duca decides to keep Soraya's secret seeing Eder so happy. Isa and Kid also break up, though Kid tells Duca privately that he had misread the situation and never had sex with Soraya. Isa informs Duca that she and Kid broke up, to which Duca offers condolences. Isa asks him if that is really how he feels and Duca admits that he is happy they are no longer together.

Dressed in only a nightgown, Zoe pounds on a neighbour's door where she gets into a physical altercation with the neighbour. As her children witness the incident, she screams 'No one hits my kids and gets away with it.' Tensions remain high as the two women and their children shout at one another and hurl insults. At Zoe's prompting, herself and her children make obscene gestures to the neighbour. They all head home, with the children asking for chips. A man then pulls up in a car and is curious as to who the children are. Zoe tells him that they belong to a mate of hers and she is just looking after them. He asks her if she would like to go for a drink. Zoe is a bit hesitant at first and she agrees to meet him at the pub that evening. Zoe reveals to her children that the man's name is David and her children seem excited about this, as there is the allusion to 'David' Beckham. . They return to their home and Zoe attempts to find a sitter for the children. She is unsuccessful in her attempt. As she speaks to her friend on the phone, she feeds sugar to her children, telling them to 'share it out, not too much.' Zoe then notices a wasp flying near one of her windows, which she opens to release it. The next scene shows Zoe wearing an extremely short skirt. She is accompanied by her children who ask where she is going, to which she replies that she is going to the pub. She tries to placate her children by telling them that there will probably be other kids there. Zoe promises her children that she will buy them something to eat at the pub. After all, their last meal consisted of pure sugar. When they arrive at their destination, Zoe leaves her children outside the pub to fend for themselves.

David states that since Zoe is 'one of those modern girls,' she should purchase the first round of drinks herself. A reluctant Zoe goes up to the bar and orders drinks. It is clear that she is strapped for cash as she constantly amends her order in order to have the cheapest possible option. Meanwhile, her children attempt to amuse themselves outside of the pub. Zoe brings them crisps and a glass of Coke. Her children are upset because Zoe did not bring them chips. She attempts to entertain them by dancing and singing.

The female patrons of the pub are exceptionally critical of her behaviour and say that she will not be laughing when she has her kids taken off her by Social Services. When Zoe checks on her children, who have been waiting outside the pub for hours, they are not pleased that Zoe wants to spend more time with David. They are bored, starved, and want to go home. David then emerges from the pub. Zoe and David spend some time getting to know one another in David's car. They begin to kiss and the camera cuts to Zoe's baby crying. It is obvious that the children are very hungry and want to go home. Four males exit the pub, one of whom drops some chips and ribs which Kelly eagerly picks up and shares with her siblings. Things then become quite heated between David and Zoe, who indulge in their passions in David's car while Zoe's children forage for food. Matters between David and Zoe are interrupted when one of her children emits an ear piercing shriek. Zoe then extricates herself from the car when she hears her child's cry. She then witnesses a wasp crawling into her baby's mouth and pleads 'don't sting him.'

On Christmas Eve, Jim prepares to give his last performance as part of the act before marrying Lila and retiring with her to a farm in Connecticut. At the last minute, Lila decides she is not ready to stop performing, and that she has fallen in love with Ted. She tells Jim that she will stay on as Ted\\'s dancing partner. While heartbroken, Jim follows through with his plan and bids the act goodbye. One year later on Christmas Eve, Jim is back in New York City. Farm life has proven difficult and he plans to turn his farm into an entertainment venue called \"Holiday Inn\", which will only be open on holidays. Ted and his agent Danny Reed  scoff at the plan, but wish him luck. Later at the airport flower shop, while ordering flowers for Lila from Ted, Danny is accosted by employee Linda Mason  who recognizes him as a talent agent and begs him for a start in show business. Danny refers her to Holiday Inn and gives her a pass to Ted\\'s club. That night, Linda sits at the performer\\'s table with Jim, who pretends he owns a big club and isn\\'t sure he could use an act like Hanover and Dixon. Linda pretends she\\'s a celebrity and friend of Ted\\'s, then escapes when the two performers come to Jim\\'s table. The next morning, Christmas Day, Linda arrives at Holiday Inn, where she meets Jim—both realizing they were fooling each other the previous evening. Jim is preparing the place for New Year\\'s Eve, and they take to one another immediately. Jim sings her his new song, \"White Christmas\", a song he would have performed had the inn been open that night. Later that week, on New Year\\'s Eve, Holiday Inn opens to a packed house. Meanwhile in New York City, Ted learns that Lila is leaving him for a Texas millionaire. Drinking heavily, he drives up to Holiday Inn to talk with Jim, arriving at midnight. While wandering aimlessly across the dance floor, Ted sees Linda, who remembers him from Christmas Eve. They dance, with Ted bringing down the house despite his inebriated state. Danny arrives just as the dance ends and is ecstatic that Ted found a new partner. The next morning, however, Ted remembers very little and doesn\\'t remember Linda at all. Jim doesn\\'t say anything and hides Linda away, afraid that Ted will steal her away from the inn. At the next performance, Lincoln\\'s Birthday, Ted and Danny return to Holiday Inn in search of Linda. Jim is ready for them and decides to run the night\\'s big minstrel show number \"Abraham\" with disguised performers, including Linda, in an effort to foil the search. While applying Linda\\'s blackface makeup, Jim asks if she will stay with him between holidays, and Linda takes this as a proposal. Having come up empty, Ted and Danny will not give up and plan to be back for the next holiday. During rehearsals for the Valentine\\'s Day performance, Jim presents Linda with a unique Valentine, a new song called \"Be Careful, It\\'s My Heart\". While singing the song with his back to her, Linda begins dancing alone, and as Ted enters, he spots Linda and launches into an impromptu romantic dance with her. Convinced that Linda is the girl he danced with on New Year\\'s Eve, Ted demands that Jim provide a number for them to perform on the next holiday, and Jim reluctantly agrees. On Washington\\'s Birthday, Ted and Linda perform in elaborate eighteenth century period costumes while Jim attempts to sabotage their dance, changing the tempo from a minuet to jazz every time the couple attempts to kiss. Afterward, Ted asks Linda to join him as his new dance partner. Linda refuses, saying she has promised to stay at the inn and that she and Jim are to be married. When Ted asks him about the marriage, Jim plays it off, but Ted is unconvinced, telling Danny he will continue to pursue Linda. At Easter, romance continues to blossom between Jim and Linda as they travel home from church in a carriage. When they reach the inn, Ted is sitting on the porch waiting from them. Ted asks Jim if he can remain in his shows, claiming he wants to experience \"the true happiness\" they\\'ve found at the inn. While Linda is charmed, Jim is suspicious. Jim\\'s suspicions are confirmed on Independence Day when he overhears Ted and Danny discussing an offer Ted received from Hollywood representatives, who will attend that night\\'s show and determine if Ted and Linda are suitable for motion pictures. Desperate, Jim bribes hired hand Gus  to ensure that Linda does not arrive at the inn. After Gus drives the inn\\'s car into a creek attempting to delay her, Linda tries to return to the inn and is picked up by Lila, who left the Texas millionaire after his tax problems were revealed. Lila tells Linda, who is pretending to be a waitress, about the studio tryout and that Lila will be Ted\\'s partner. Assuming that Jim arranged for her to take Linda\\'s place, Linda directs Lila into the same river. Back at the inn, Ted is forced to perform a solo dance. When Linda eventually makes her way to the inn, she finds that Ted has impressed the studio honchos with his improvised solo and the opportunity stands. Irritated with Jim for not trusting her to make her own decision, Linda takes the offer and leaves for Hollywood. The producers want to make a film about Holiday Inn, and Jim reluctantly agrees. At Thanksgiving, the inn is closed and Jim is deeply depressed, barely touching the turkey dinner prepared by his housekeeper Mamie . Jim is prepared to mail to Hollywood a recording of his new Thanksgiving song, but, before he does, he plays it on a record player and makes negative comments over the positive ones in the recording. Realizing what is wrong and ignoring decorum, Mamie implores him to travel to California to win Linda back by telling her how he really feels. Jim arrives at the studio on Christmas Eve, just as Ted is preparing to leave with Linda to get married. Jim confronts Ted in his dressing room, then locks him in it. Before Linda films the final scene for her movie, which features a recreation of Holiday Inn, Jim walks around the set with the director, who boasts it is the most exact recreation ever created for a motion picture. Jim leaves his pipe on the set\\'s piano and hides nearby. Linda enters the room and sits at the piano, performing \"White Christmas\". Startled by the pipe\\'s presence, she falters, then continues as Jim\\'s voice joins her. Jim appears and Linda runs to him as the director yells \"cut\". Meanwhile, Ted and Danny learn of Jim\\'s plan, but they are too late to stop him. At Holiday Inn on New Year\\'s Eve, Ted is reunited with Lila, who is ready and willing to perform with him again. Jim and Linda prepare to stay together and run the inn.',\n",

       "  'By 2044, the United States has suffered economic collapse, causing severe social decay and growth in organized crime. In addition, a mutation has occurred in 10% of the population giving them telekinetic powers. Time travel is invented in 2074, but is immediately outlawed. Tracking technology has rendered it nearly impossible to dispose of bodies secretly, so crime bosses send their targets back to the past where they are killed by \"loopers\": assassins paid with silver bars strapped to the victim. When crime bosses want to end a looper\\'s contract , the looper will kill his future self and get paid instead with gold bars. Failing to close the loop is punishable by death. In 2044, Joe Simmons  is a looper for a mafia company in Kansas. His boss Abe  was sent from the future to manage the loopers and also owns a club that Joe frequents, and where he spends time with Suzie , a showgirl. Abe controls his own group of hired muscle, the \"Gat Men\", including the overconfident Kid Blue , who is desperate to prove himself to Abe. One night, Joe\\'s friend Seth  visits him and tells him that he was supposed to close his own loop, but hesitated. Before Seth\\'s future self escaped, he mentions the Rainmaker, a man who has taken over future organized crime and is closing all loops. Joe attempts to protect Seth, but betrays him to Abe instead of surrendering half of his silver, which he has secretly been stashing for his retirement. The mafia capture Seth and start mutilating him, knowing that the injuries will be translated to his future self. They scar an address on his arm which he has to go to. Along the way, Old Seth begins losing body parts, and upon arriving at the location he is killed by Kid Blue, closing the loop. Later, during a contract, Joe hesitates when he recognizes the target is his future self, allowing him to escape. After meeting in a diner, Old Joe  tells Joe that the Rainmaker sent him back to be killed, and that Old Joe\\'s wife was killed during his capture. Old Joe killed his captors and traveled back to kill the Rainmaker as a child. Joe attempts to kill Old Joe and fulfill his contract, but both of them flee when they are attacked by the Gat Men. Joe tears a scrap off a map Old Joe had, bearing a marked location and a string of digits. Old Joe uses the numbers to search a database, getting three possible children born on the same day in the same hospital, and he intends to kill all three. Joe follows the map to a farmhouse owned by Sara , who lives with her son Cid. When Joe shows Sara the map, Sara recognizes the digits as Cid\\'s birthday and the serial number of the hospital he was born in, prompting Joe to explain the situation. Joe tells Sara about the Rainmaker and the danger they\\'re in, and offers to stay and protect them, killing Old Joe when he comes around. As Joe and Sara become close, he learns that she is a telekinetic, and that Cid was raised by Sara\\'s sister for most of his life until she was killed. Cid does not believe that Sara is his real mother. One morning, they are attacked by Gat Man Jesse, who is killed when Cid falls down the stairs and lets out a telekinetic blast. Joe believes that Cid is the Rainmaker, and Sara confirms that Cid inadvertently killed her sister when he lost control of his powers. Meanwhile, Old Joe is captured by Kid Blue. Joe tells Sara and Cid to flee, surmising that his employers or Old Joe will target the farm. Meanwhile, Old Joe breaks free, killing Abe and all the Gat Men except for Kid Blue, whom Old Joe presumed to be dead. As the two Joes confront each other near Sara\\'s house, Kid Blue attacks and is killed by young Joe. Old Joe escapes during the attack, then finds and attempts to kill Cid, prompting Cid to let out another telekinetic blast. However, before Cid can kill Old Joe, Sara calms him down and assures him by telling him his mother is with him. Old Joe tries to kill Cid again, but Sara stands between them. Joe realizes that if Old Joe kills Sara, it will traumatize Cid in a way that will contribute to him becoming the Rainmaker, thus creating a closed time loop.

On a shopping trip to Tokyo, Noriko encounters one of her father\\'s friends, Professor Jo Onodera , who lives in Kyoto, and they go to a restaurant together. Noriko knows that Onodera, who had been a widower like her father, has recently remarried, and she tells him that she finds the very idea of his remarriage distasteful, even \"filthy.\" Onodera, and later her father, tease her for having such thoughts.  Shukichi\\'s sister, Aunt Masa , convinces him that it is high time his daughter got married. Noriko is friendly with her father’s assistant, Hattori , and Aunt Masa suggests to her brother that he ask Noriko if she might be interested in Hattori. When he does bring up the subject, however, Noriko laughs: Hattori already has been engaged to another young woman for quite some time. Undaunted, Masa tries to serve as her niece’s matchmaker. She pressures Noriko to meet with a marriageable young man, a Tokyo University graduate named Satake who, Masa believes, bears a strong resemblance to Gary Cooper. Noriko declines, explaining that she doesn’t wish to marry anyone, because to do so would leave her father alone and helpless. Masa surprises Noriko by claiming that she is also trying to arrange a match between Shukichi and Mrs. Miwa , an attractive young widow known to Noriko. If Masa succeeds, Shukichi would have someone other than Noriko to care for him. At a Noh performance attended by Noriko and her father, the latter smilingly greets Mrs. Miwa, which triggers Noriko\\'s jealousy. When her father later tries to talk her into going to meet Satake, he tells her that he intends to marry Mrs. Miwa. Devastated, Noriko reluctantly decides to meet the young man and, to her surprise, gains a very favorable impression of him. Shaken by thoughts of her father taking a second wife, Noriko consents to the arranged marriage with Satake. The Somiyas go on one last trip before the wedding to Kyoto, where they meet Prof. Onodera and his family. Noriko changes her opinion of Onodera\\'s remarriage when she discovers that his new wife is a nice person. While packing their luggage for the trip home, Noriko asks her father why they can\\'t simply stay as they are now, even if he does remarry – she is very happy living with him and marriage certainly wouldn’t make her any happier. Shukichi admonishes her, saying that she must embrace the new life she will build with Satake, one in which he, Shukichi, will have no part, because \"that’s the order of human life and history.\" Noriko asks her father’s forgiveness for her \"selfishness\" and agrees to go ahead with the marriage. Noriko’s wedding day arrives. At home just before the ceremony, both Shukichi and Masa admire Noriko, who is dressed in a traditional wedding costume. Noriko thanks her father for the care he has taken of her throughout her life and leaves in a hired car for the wedding. Afterwards, Aya , a divorced friend of Noriko’s, goes with Shukichi to a bar, where he confesses that his claim that he was going to marry Mrs. Miwa was a ruse all along: he had never intended to remarry at all. He had said so only to help persuade Noriko to get married herself. Aya, touched by his sacrifice, promises to visit him often. Shukichi returns home and faces the quiet night all alone.',\n",

A Japanese air raid sinks Sea Tiger while she is docked at the Cavite Navy Yard in the Philippines on 10 December 1941. Lieutenant Commander Sherman and his crew begin repairs, hoping to sail for Darwin, Australia before the Japanese overrun the port. Lieutenant Nick Holden  is reassigned to Sea Tiger despite lacking any submarine training or experience. He and Sherman clash over Holden\\'s attitude toward the Navy; Holden became a naval officer not out of patriotism but to escape poverty and find a wealthy spouse, and is engaged to such a woman. Holden demonstrates great skill as a scavenger and con artist to obtain materials for repairs, however, and becomes the ship\\'s supply officer.

When Sherman prepares to attack an enemy oiler, Crandall accidentally launches the torpedo prematurely, blowing up a truck on the beach.

When Sherman is unable to obtain needed supplies officially, he allows Holden to set up a casino to get them.

During a game Gehrig trips over a stack of bats and is teased by a spectator, Eleanor , who laughingly calls him \"tanglefoot\". Their relationship grows, and soon Lou pops the question.

One day, in Detroit, he tells Yankees manager Joe McCarthy ([[Harry Harvey  that he has become a detriment to the team and benches himself.

A year later, at Lou Gehrig Day at Yankee Stadium, an older Billy  finds Gehrig and shows him that he has made a full recovery, inspired by his hero\\'s example and the two-homer fulfilled promise. Then, as Eleanor weeps softly in the stands, Gehrig addresses the fans: \"People all say that I\\'ve had a bad break,\" he says. \"But today ... today, I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth.\"',\n",

The Lost Girl’s television displays a family of surreal anthropomorphic rabbits who speak in cryptic statements and questions. Occasionally, there are laugh track responses within these Rabbit scenes. These three elements become recurring motifs throughout Inland Empire. The majority of the first act takes place in Los Angeles. A local actress named Nikki Grace  has applied for a comeback role in a film entitled On High in Blue Tomorrows. The day before the audition, Nikki is visited by an enigmatic old woman from Poland  who claims to be her neighbour. The old woman insists that Nikki has won the role, and recounts two Polish folk tales. One tells of a boy who, sparking a reflection after passing through a doorway, “caused evil to be born”. The other tells of a girl who, wandering through an alleyway behind a marketplace, “discovers a palace”. The old woman presses Nikki for details on her new film, asking whether the story is about marriage and involves murder. Nikki denies both, but her neighbour stridently disagrees. Disregarding Nikki’s troubled response, the old woman comments on the confusion of time, claiming that were this tomorrow, Nikki would be sitting on a couch adjacent to them. The film then pans to where the neighbour is pointing, and we see Nikki and two girlfriends sitting on the couch. Her butler walks into the living room – where the old woman no longer reclines – with a phone call from her agent, announcing that she has won the role. Ecstatic, Nikki and her friends celebrate while her husband Piotrek  ominously surveys them from atop a nearby stairwell. Some time later, Nikki and her co-star Devon Berk  receive an interview on a talk show called The Marilyn Levees Show. The host  asks both actors whether they are having an affair, to which each of them respond negatively. Devon has been warned by his entourage that Nikki is out-of-bounds, due to her husband’s power and influence. Later, on the set being built for the film, Nikki and Devon rehearse a scene with the director Kingsley . They are interrupted by a disturbance, but Devon finds nothing upon investigation. Shaken by the event, Kingsley confesses that they are shooting a remake of a German feature entitled 47. Production was abandoned after both leads were murdered, creating rumours of the film being cursed due to its roots in an old Polish folk tale. Immersed in her character \"Sue\", Nikki appears to begin an affair with Devon – under the guise of his own character \"Billy\". While filming a scene in which her character buys groceries, Nikki notices a door in the alley marked Axxon N, and enters. It leads to a room behind the studio, where she can see herself rehearsing her lines weeks earlier. When Devon is sent to find who\\'s lurking backstage, Nikki realizes that she was the disturbance, causing her to flee among the half-built backgrounds and into the house of another character named Smithy. Despite the set being merely a wooden facade, Nikki enters to find an illuminated suburban house inside. Devon looks through the windows, but sees only darkness. At this point, the film takes a drastic stylistic turn. Various plotlines and scenes begin to entwine and complement each other. The chronological order is often confused or nonexistent. Inside the house, Nikki finds her husband in bed. Hiding from him, she encounters a troupe of prostitutes. One of the women advises her to “gaze through a burn hole in the silk”. Nikki complies and witnesses several strange happenings – many of which seem to revolve around her, or an alternate version of herself. The woman who plays Doris Side - Billy’s wife in the film , tells a policeman that she has been hypnotized to murder someone with a screwdriver – but finds the screwdriver embedded in her own side. A mysterious organization claims to have captives from Inland Empire. In the past, Polish prostitutes are confronted by strange pimps while murder permeates their city. Nikki, having become one of the prostitutes in the present, wanders the streets while her companions directly ask the audience “Who is she?” Both Nikki and her prostitutes frequently ask people to look at them, and say whether “you\\'ve known me before”. In a parallel plotline, Sue climbs the dark staircase behind a nightclub to deliver a long monologue to a Jewish Rabbi named Mr. K – which touches upon her childhood molestations, disastrous relationships and revenge missions. Her husband Smithy seems to be connected with both the pimps and the organization – and is said to be good with animals, hence his job with a circus from Poland. There is much talk of The Phantom, an elusive hypnotist. Convinced she’s being stalked by a red-lipped man, Sue arms herself with a screwdriver. Finally, Sue walks down Hollywood Boulevard, and is startled to see her doppelgänger across the street. Before Sue can investigate, Doris arrives and attempts to kill her, having been hypnotized by The Phantom. Sue is brutally stabbed in the stomach with her own screwdriver, causing her to stagger down the street and eventually collapse next to some homeless people on the corner of Hollywood and Vine. An Afro-American woman remarks that Sue is dying, then proceeds to debate with another, younger homeless woman about taking a bus to Pomona. Her companion talks at length about a friend named Niko – the prostitute whose blond wig makes her look like a movie star, thus allowing her to walk through the rich district without drawing attention. The Afro-American woman comforts Sue by holding a lighter in front of her face, until she finally dies, “having no more blue tomorrows”. Off-camera, Kingsley yells “cut”, and the camera pans back to show this has merely been a film scene. As the actors and film crew wrap for the next scene, Sue slowly arises, Nikki once more. Kingsley announces that her scenes for the film are complete. In a daze, Nikki wanders off set and into a nearby cinema, where she sees not only On High in Blue Tomorrows – encompassing some of the subplots of the film – but events that are currently occurring. She wanders to the projection room, but finds an apartment building marked *Axxon N*. Eventually, Nikki confronts the red-lipped man from earlier, now known to be The Phantom. She shoots him, which causes his face to morph first into a distorted copy of Nikki\\'s own face, but then into something resembling a foetus bleeding from its mouth. Nikki flees into a nearby room – Room 47, which houses the rabbits on television, though she fails to see them. Elsewhere in the building, Nikki finds The Lost Girl, who has been watching and crying all along. The two women kiss, before Nikki fades away into the light along with the rabbits. The Lost Girl runs out of the hotel and into Smithy’s house, where she happily embraces a man and child. Nikki is then seen back home, triumphantly smiling at the old woman from the beginning of the film. The concluding scene takes place at her house, where she sits with many other people, among them Laura Harring, Nastassja Kinski and Ben Harper. A one-legged woman who was mentioned in Sue\\'s monologue looks around and says, “Sweet!” Niko, the girl with the blonde wig and monkey, can also be seen. The end credits roll over a group of women dancing to Nina Simone\\'s \"Sinner Man\" while a lumberjack saws a log to the beat.',\n",

       "  \" In 1970, Andoheb, the aging High Priest of Arkam , has summoned Yousef Bey to the Temple of Arkam to pass on the duties of High Priest. Beforehand, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to Bey. Meanwhile in Mapleton, Massachusetts, Professor Matthew Norman, whom had examined one of Kharis' missing bandage pieces during the Mummy's last spree through Mapleton, also explains the legends of the Priests of Arkam and Kharis to his History class who are less than believing. After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey, meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori, a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. However, a strange, clouded feeling in her mind occurs when ever the subject of Egypt is mentioned. Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousef’s mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey pledges his devotion before Andoheb explains that during each full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from nine tana leaves. Kharis will sense this and find the leaves wherever they are. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on a case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing nine tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that. The battered, ragged form of Kharis the Mummy, however, senses the leaves brewing and heads toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and she follows him in a trance-like state. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman, strangles him, and drinks the fluid of the tana leaves. Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to faint. She falls to the ground with a strange birthmark now apparent on her wrist. The next morning, the Sheriff and Coroner discover a strange mold around the dead Professor’s throat – a sign they both know to mean that the Mummy stalks Mapleton again. Sheriff Elwood questions Amina, who is dazed, but Tom Hervey arrives and tries to provide an alibi for her. The Sheriff finally dismisses the pair and Tom takes her home. Later, Yousef Bey, who has arrived in Mapleton, calls on Amon-Ra to aid him in his quest and begins to brew the sacred fluid of the tana leaves to summon Kharis. Kharis senses the leaves and heads toward them, murdering a helpless farmer along the way. The Sheriff soon arrives on the scene and organizes a search party. The next day, at the Scripps Museum, Yousef Bey lags behind a tour group viewing the Mummy of Ananka. After closing time, Yousef emerges from a hiding place as Kharis breaks into the museum. Kharis attempts to touch the mummified body, but it disintegrates under the wrapping as his hand approaches. Yousef Bey realizes that Ananka’s soul has been reincarnated into another form. Kharis is enraged and begins destroying the exhibit, attracting the museum security guard who is mercilessly slaughtered by Kharis. Police Inspector Walgreen and Dr. Ayad from the museum are bewildered as to how Ananka’s body has disappeared without disturbing the wrappings. Dr. Ayad matches markings on the tomb to those on a cask of tana leaves and Inspector Walgreen decides to use the leaves to attract and capture Kharis. The plan is to build a pit to confine the creature until a way to deal with him can be found. Amina is still unable to shake the haunted feelings that torture her and Tom, disregarding the Sheriff’s warnings, asks Amina to elope with him to New York. She agrees and the two make plans to leave early the next morning. Meanwhile, Yousef Bey calls upon Amon Ra to lead him to the new home of Ananka’s soul and then sends Kharis in that direction to find Ananka. Inspector Walgreen now begins to bait his trap by burning nine tana leaves and Kharis immediately heads toward the Norman home. Amina is awakened by his approach and hypnotically wanders into the yard. Kharis recognizes her as the carrier of Ananka’s soul and Amina faints as Kharis picks her up and takes her away. The abduction is witnessed by Mrs. Blake, Amina's guardian, who phones Tom to alert him. Tom immediately sets out in pursuit while Mrs. Blake heads to the Norman house and tells her story to Inspector Walgreen, Sheriff Elwood and a large group of volunteers. Kharis arrives at the mill and presents Amina to Yousef Bey. Bey recognizes the birthmark on her wrist as the symbol of the Priests of Arkam. Amina awakens and the Priest informs her that she is, indeed, the reincarnation of Ananka. Yousef Bey now begins to admire Amina’s beauty and cannot deny the temptations he feels to keep her alive as his bride. He decides to use the tana leaves to keep her young and beautiful forever which enrages Kharis. Before Yousef Bey can give Amina the fluid, the Mummy knocks the cup away and exacts his vengeance on the Priest, who falls out a window to his death. Tom Hervey now arrives and witnesses the death of the Priest. He rushes up the stairs to the mill but is met by Kharis. A struggle ensues and Tom is quickly overwhelmed. Kharis attempts to escape with Amina and the mob pursues the Mummy and his Princess into the nearby swamps. In Kharis’ arms, Amina/Ananka is now aging rapidly. They are chased deeper and deeper into the swamps and now begin to sink into the bog. Tom’s last anguished sight of Amina is that of a 3,000 year old Egyptian Princess as Kharis and Ananka disappear under the water, united in death.\",\n",

It also describes the cultural differences experienced by a small town girl on moving to a transposed environment. The film opens with the marriage proceedings of a South Indian arranged marriage between Lakshmi  and Prithvi . Lakshmi is a typical South Indian girl from Chidambaram; Prithvi is a software engineer working in California. After the wedding, they move to the USA where Lakshmi gradually tries to fit into her new surroundings. The marriage is a happy union: Prithvi works hard at work, Lakshmi manages the home, and they grow to love one other deeply. Within a year, they are blessed with a baby girl Divya . The film flashes forward 17 years. Divya is a typical adolescent: she goes to school, plays soccer, and occasionally attends parties . Lakshmi does not take to the partying very well, and tensions rise between mother and daughter. Divya aspires independence, and expresses herself by sidelining Lakshmi; Lakshmi wants her to be responsible, and expresses this by checking up on Divya a bit too much for Divya to be comfortable. Prithvi understands both sides, and tries to cope with Divya\\'s growing up, but not always with full cognizance of Lakshmi\\'s feelings. Things escalate one evening when Divya kisses her boyfriend Robbie outside her home.

She becomes fast friends with her new neighbors Steve  and his kid brother Paul. Prithvi keeps his distance, however.

Foghorn counters by taking a pie from a nearby windowsill, then mashing it into Dawg's face . The Dawg, his face covered with cream, chases Foghorn but is strangled by his rope. Foghorn returns, and like a barber, uses a straight razor to remove the cream from the Dawg's face. The Dawg becomes incapacitated when Foghorn places a large metal pipe over his body. Foghorn then gets a scalding hot towel from a pot of boiling water and places in on the helpless Dawg's face. Henery enters the scene looking for a chicken. Henery approaches the Dawg, who is sharpening an ax on a grinder, and thinking the Dawg is a chicken tries to pull him from behind with the Dawg's neck rope.

Foghorn swings, but hits the Dawg instead of the ball, sending the Dawg  toward a tree. Foghorn then covers Henery with vanishing cream and Henery is led to believe that he is invisible. Henery, still under the impression that the Dawg is a pheasant, leaves in pursuit. The Dawg uses a mirror to prove to Henery that he is not really invisible and that he has been tricked again by Foghorn.

Foghorn convinces Henery to resume his quest for the pheasant, citing historical episodes. The Dawg finally explains to Henery that as a chicken hawk he should be after chicken and asks Henery to unhook his from his rope. The Dawg lures Foghorn from hiding and they start a fight.

       "  ' In the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh during May 1973, the Cambodian national army is fighting a civil war with the communist Khmer Rouge, a result of the Vietnam War overspilling that country’s borders. Dith Pran, a Cambodian journalist and interpreter for The New York Times, awaits the arrival of reporter Sydney Schanberg at the city\\'s airport but leaves suddenly. Schanberg, whose flight arrives three hours late, takes a cab to his hotel where he meets up with Al Rockoff . Pran meets Schanberg later and tells him that an incident has occurred in a town, Neak Leung; allegedly, an American B-52 has bombed the town by mistake. Schanberg and Pran try to find transport. Pran is able to sneak them both onto a police boat. It that takes them to Neak Leung where they find that the town has been bombed and hundreds killed and wounded, including women and children. Schanberg and Pran are arrested when they try to photograph the execution of two Khmer Rouge operatives by Cambodian army officers. They are eventually released and Schanberg is furious when the international press corps arrives with the U.S. Army to report a sanitised version of the story. Two years later, in 1975, the embassies are being evacuated in anticipation of the arrival of the Khmer Rouge. Schanberg secures evacuation for Pran, his wife and their four children. However, Pran insists that he would stay behind to help Schanberg, but Pran\\'s family leaves. The Khmer Rouge move into the capital, ostensibly in peace. During a parade through the city, Schanberg, suspicious of the positive way the Khmer Rouge are being welcomed, meets Rockoff, who tells him that he had just come from an area where heavy fighting was taking place. They are later met by a detachment of the Khmer Rouge, who immediately arrest them. Pran is not allowed into the armoured personnel carrier at first, but is able to bribe the Khmer Rouge leader. The group is taken through the city to a back alley where prisoners are being held and executed. Pran, unharmed because he is a Cambodian civilian, negotiates with the Khmer Rouge officer in command for several hours to spare the lives of his friends. They are set free, joining the thousands of refugees fleeing the capital. They do not leave Phnom Penh, but instead retreat to the French embassy and stay there for several days, awaiting their chance to evacuate. Informed that the Khmer Rouge have ordered all Cambodian citizens in the embassy to be handed over and fearing the embassy will be overrun, the embassies comply. Knowing that Pran will be imprisoned or killed, Rockoff and fellow photographer Jon Swain  of The Sunday Times try to forge a British passport for Pran. They use supplies they find in the embassy buildings; however, the picture fades. With no other options available, Pran is turned over to the Khmer Rouge and is forced to live under their totalitarian regime. Several months after returning to New York City, Schanberg is in the midst of a personal campaign to locate Pran. He has appealed to many humanitarian organisations and has kept in close contact with Pran\\'s family in San Francisco. In Cambodia, Pran has become a forced labourer under the Khmer Rouge\\'s \"Year Zero\" policy, a return to the agrarian ways of the past. Pran labours in rice fields under the watchful eyes of young children of both sexes, whom the Khmer Rouge hold in high regard as the future leaders of their regime. Pran is also forced to attend propagandist classes where many undergo re-education. As intellectuals are made to disappear, Pran feigns simple-mindedness. Eventually, he tries to escape, but is recaptured. Before he is found by members of the Khmer Rouge, he slips into a muddy cesspool filled with rotting human corpses; in doing so, he stumbles upon the infamous killing fields of the Pol Pot regime, where it murdered millions of Cambodian citizens. Sydney Schanberg receives a journalism award for his coverage of the Cambodian conflict. At the acceptance dinner he tells the audience that half the recognition for the award belongs to Pran. At the restroom, he is confronted by Rockoff who harshly accuses him of not doing enough to locate Pran and for using his friend to win the award. Schanberg defends his efforts, saying that he has contacted every humanitarian relief agency possible in the four years since Pran\\'s disappearance. Rockoff suggests that Schanberg subtly pressured Pran to remain in Cambodia because Pran was so vital to Sydney\\'s work. This accusation hits close to home, and Schanberg begins to wonder whether he put his own self-interest ahead of Pran\\'s safety. He finally confesses that Pran \"stayed because I wanted him to stay\". Pran is assigned to the leader of a different prison compound, a man named Phat, and charged mostly with tending to his little boy. Pran continues his self-imposed discipline of behaving as an uneducated peasant, despite several of Phat’s attempts to trick him into revealing his knowledge of both French and English. Phat begins to trust Pran and asks him to take ward of his son in the event that he is killed. The Khmer Rouge are now engaged in a border war with Vietnam. The conflict reaches Pran\\'s region and a battle ensues between the Khmer Rouge of the compound and two jets sent to destroy the camp. After the skirmish has ended, Pran discovers that Phat\\'s son has American money and a map leading to safety.

In the confusion, Pran escapes with four other prisoners and they begin a long trek through the jungle with Phat’s young son. The group later splits and three of them head in a different direction; Pran continues following the map with one of them. However, Pran’s companion steps on a hidden land mine while holding the child. Though Pran pleads with the man to give him the child, the mine goes off, killing them both. Pran mourns for a time and continues on. One day he crests the escarpment of the Dangrek Mountains and sees a Red Cross camp near the border of Thailand. The scene shifts to Schanberg calling Pran\\'s family with the news that Pran is alive and safe. Soon after, Schanberg travels to the Red Cross camp and is reunited with Pran.

In her childhood, her family and friends are evicted from their low-rent housing so that developers can turn it into expensive, seaview flats. Later in life, she vows to buy her mum and dad a new flat, but is unable to fulfill her promise before her mother dies. When her father becomes ill, she begins searching in earnest for a new place, finally fixating on the expensive building that now stands where she previously lived with her family. The flat costs millions, though, and the bank will only give her a 70% mortgage. The payments would reach over $15,000, and her two part-time jobs might not permit her to pay that. Unfortunately, because of an oversight in declaring her father's medical history, she no longer has insurance to pay for his expensive treatment. Thus, Lai-sheung must get a second job to save enough money for the flat of her dreams. Though she saves enough for a down-payment, her fathers medical bills become excessive. Lai-sheung asks her married lover to loan her some money for medical bills, but he refuses. One night, her father has trouble breathing; instead of giving him his oxygen, Lai-sheung allows her father to die. The insurance payment adds enough money to her current savings for her to purchase her dream flat. She immediately calls her real estate agent and agrees to take the flat at No 1 Victoria Bay. On her way to finalise the agreement, there is a hike in the stock market that makes the owners decide to raise the price. This sends Lai-sheung into a devastating frenzy where she attacks people who live in the high-rise, killing them with low-tech and household items. First, it is a security guard, whom she suffocates with a zip-tie. Next, she goes upstairs and kills a pregnant woman, her in-house helper, and her cheating husband. Upon hearing loud music from the upstairs flat, Lai-sheung goes up a floor and kills the five people partying in the apartment. During the course of these attacks, Lai-sheung is scratched on the face and stabbed in the ankle. She forms a tourniquet with her sock and another zip-tie. The police arrive at the flat, demanding entry. A struggle ensues, and both officers are  killed. Lai-sheung returns to her day job, and receives a call from her agent. He claims that the owners of the flat wish to sell after all. Lai-sheung suggests that they might want to sell for a much lower price, since there were 11 murders in the building the previous evening. That night, Lai-sheung's lover comes round to pick her up, but she turns her back on him and walks away, ending their relationship.\",\n",

The details of the operation  are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan  and Major Harvey . They are initially unable to devise such a plan - but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, who looks just like General Bernard Montgomery. Logan and Harvey discover that the actor is M. E. Clifton James , a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour North Africa, impersonating \"Monty\". \"Jimmy\" as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees.

       "  ' The story begins with Mortimer Folchart  and his wife, Resa  reading the fairy tale \"Little Red Riding Hood\" to their baby daughter Meggie. As Mo reads the story, a red velvet hood appears as a narrator explains that people known as \"Silver Tongues\" are born with the gift that whenever they read a story out loud, the story becomes real. 12 years later, Mortimer and Meggie  are in the European countrysides looking for a book. Mo has learned of his gifts, and nine years prior, Resa had vanished, much to the distress of her extended family. Hearing the calling of books from a bookstore one day, Mo ventures inside. He finds the book Inkheart and is overwhelmed with a mixture of fear and joy. At the same time, Dustfinger , a character from Inkheart appears and attempts to persuade Mo to read him back into the book. Mo refuses to do so and hastily escapes with Meggie and travels to Italy to pay a visit to Meggie\\'s great aunt Elinor Loredan . Elinor accuses Resa of running off, which upsets Meggie, but the two make amends when expressing their mutual passion for valuable books, and Elinor lets Meggie stay in her library to read. Dustfinger appears again, but this time having informed the book\\'s villain Capricorn  and bringing his minion Basta  to capture Mo and his family and take back the book, in the meantime destroying Elinor\\'s valuable collection of books. The trio are taken to Capricorn\\'s castle and imprisoned in the stables, which house various creatures from storybooks, such as the ticking Crocodile from Peter Pan, flying monkeys from The Wizard of Oz, and the title character of The Hound of the Baskervilles, as well as the minotaur from the story of Theseus and a unicorn. Mo explains his gift to Meggie and Elinor, stating that when he reads a person out of a book, someone from the real world is sent into it, hence the disappearance of his wife. They are abruptly taken to meet with Capricorn, and meet his current reader Darius ([[John Thomson , whose perpetual stutter had caused those he had read out of the book to only come halfway out of the story, with various deformities and the words of the stories written on their faces. Capricorn breaks his promise to Dustfinger to have him read back into the book, and throws it onto the fire, burning it. In his despair, Dustfinger leaves the group and runs to the kitchen, where he learns that one of the servant girls, a trusted friend of his who is constantly attempting to escape, is in fact Mo\\'s lost wife Resa, whose halfway transition from the book she was trapped in has left her without a voice. He gives her the access to escape and departs. After reading from The Arabian Nights and giving Capricorn a stash of treasure, one of Ali Baba\\'s thieves, Farid , is summoned from the story and joins the storyteller and his family in imprisonment. Dustfinger opts not to tell Mo that his wife is in the village and prompts a quick escape using the famous cyclone from The Wizard of Oz. After they escape, Meggie offers the idea that only the author of Inkheart, Fenoglio (Jim Broadbent  may have access to a copy of the rare-to-find book. After learning of the author\\'s location and traveling to his town, Elinor decides to leave to recover what is left of her book collection. Dustfinger stays behind with Farid partly in order to teach him how to juggle fire, but also due to the fact he is afraid of learning his fate at the end of the book. Fenoglio cannot resist approaching his creation and inadvertently blurts out that Dustfinger dies in the novel while saving his marten Gwin. This devastates the fire juggler, who states that the writer is not his god, and he can deem whatever fate he chooses. While Mo attempts to find a way of reading Resa out of the book, Dustfinger has no choice but to confess that she was at Capricorn\\'s village, prompting him and Mo to take Fenoglio\\'s car and leave Meggie behind with Fenoglio. They discover that Farid had stowed away in the car\\'s trunk, and take him along at his insistence. Elsewhere, Elinor has a change of heart and does not take the train back to Italy. Meanwhile, Meggie learns that she has inherited her father\\'s gift when she accidentally summons Toto from The Wizard of Oz. Basta comes and takes Meggie and Fenoglio back to Capricorn\\'s village. Capricorn intends to use Meggie to read the Shadow, Inkheart\\'s supernatural and most deadly villain, out of the book and into the real world, using a copy of the book he had secretly kept to himself. After a brief reunion with her mother, Meggie is coerced into cooperating or risk Capricorn killing Resa. Elinor in the meantime discovers Fenoglio\\'s ransacked apartment and rents a motorbike to save her family. As Mo, Farid and Dustfinger work on a plan of burning down Capricorn\\'s castle, Dustfinger is captured. After escaping his cell, he attempts to free Meggie and Fenoglio who is working on a way to rewrite the ending of the Shadow for her to read. He is unable to free them, and flees, only to return at his conscience  beckoning. Meggie is escorted out to read the Shadow out of the book, and Fenoglio and Resa are caged to be his first meal. Fenoglio manages to use Toto to give her a page that he had written, and she manages to call off the Shadow. In the scuffle, she loses the rewrite and Shadow attempts again to kill Resa, Fenoglio, and Mo, who had intervened in the fight. Mo gives Meggie a pen to write her own ending, and using her arm, Meggie manages to send all the book characters back to their own stories, and at Fenoglio\\'s request, sends him into the Inkheart world as well. Dustfinger misses his chance to return, and departs when Elinor, Resa, Mo and Meggie embrace, where Meggie discovers that Inkheart had been taken. Farid catches up with Dustfinger, insisting on traveling with him to find another reader to send Dustfinger back into the copy of Inkheart that Farid had stolen before the castle collapsed. After a moment\\'s hesitation, Dustfinger agrees, and the two start off together, only to have Mo come up to fulfill his promise to return Dustfinger to his book. Dustfinger is transported safely back into Inkheart, where he reunites with his wife Roxane . Farid reveals to the family that Dustfinger\\'s fate has been changed, as he pulls Gwin out of a travel pack he is carrying, and without the marten to sacrifice himself for, Dustfinger is again in control of his destiny. Meggie and Resa invite Farid to live with them, and Meggie agrees to teach him how to read and Farid agrees to teach her how to use the dragon fire.',\n",
       "  'Joseph, son of Israel  and Rachel, lived in the land of Canaan with eleven brothers and one sister. He was Rachel\\'s firstborn and Israel\\'s eleventh son. Of all the sons, Joseph was loved by his father the most. Israel even arrayed Joseph with a \"long coat of many colors\".Another possible translation is \"coat with long sleeves\" - see \"A Dictionary of the Targumim, Talmud Bavli, Talmud Yerushalmi and Midrashic Literature\", 1903. ISBN 1-932443-20-7 Israel\\'s favoritism toward Joseph caused his half brothers to hate him, and when Joseph was seventeen years old he had two dreams that made his brothers plot his demise. In the first dream, Joseph and his brothers gathered bundles of grain. Then, all of the grain bundles that had been prepared by the brothers gathered around Joseph\\'s bundle and bowed down to it. In the second dream, the sun , the moon  and eleven stars  bowed down to Joseph himself. When he told these two dreams to his brothers, they despised him for the implications that the family would be bowing down to Joseph. They became jealous that their father would even ponder over Joseph\\'s words concerning these dreams.  They saw their chance when they were feeding the flocks, the brothers saw Joseph from afar and plotted to kill him. They turned on him and stripped him of the coat his father made for him, and threw him into a pit. As they pondered what to do with Joseph, the brothers saw a camel caravan of Ishmaelites coming out of Gilead, carrying spices and perfumes to Egypt, for trade. Judah, the strongest, thought twice about killing Joseph and proposed that he be sold. The traders paid twenty pieces of silver for Joseph, and the brothers took Joseph\\'s coat back to Jacob, who assumed Joseph had been killed by wild animals.  The text of the biblical story is muddled over who sold Joseph into slavery - which of the brothers, Reuben or Judah, and whether he was sold to Midianite traders or Ishmaelite traders. What is clear is that Joseph was sold to serve Potiphar, the captain of Pharaoh\\'s guard.,  While serving in Potiphar\\'s household, Yahweh was with Joseph so that he prospered in everything he did. Joseph found favor in the sight of Potiphar and so he became his personal servant. Then Joseph was promoted to oversee Potiphar\\'s entire household as a superintendent. After some time, Potiphar\\'s wife began to desire Joseph and sought to have an affair with him. Despite her persistence, he refused to have sex with her for fear of sinning against God. After some days of begging for him, she grabbed him by his cloak, but he escaped from her leaving his garment behind. Angered by his running away from her, she took his garment and made a false claim against him by charging that he tried have sex with her. This resulted in Joseph being thrown into prison.Josephus claims that Potiphar basically fell for his wife\\'s crocodile tears even though he couldn\\'t believe that Joseph was capable of \"making sport\" of his wife. - Josephus. The Antiquities of the Jews, Book II, 4.1-5   The warden put Joseph in charge of the other prisoners, and soon afterward Pharaoh\\'s chief cup bearer and chief baker, who had offended the Pharaoh, were thrown into the prison. They both had dreams, and they asked Joseph to help interpret them. The chief cup bearer had held a vine in his hand, with three branches that brought forth grapes; he took them to Pharoah and put them in his cup. The chief baker had three baskets of bread on his head, intended for Pharoah, but some birds came along and ate the bread. Joseph told them that within three days the chief cup bearer would be reinstated but the chief baker would be hanged. Joseph requested the cup bearer to mention him to Pharaoh and secure his release from prison, but the cup bearer, reinstalled in office, forgot Joseph. After Joseph was in prison for two more years, Pharaoh had two dreams which disturbed him. He dreamt of seven lean cows which rose out of the river and devoured seven fat cows; and, of seven withered ears of grain which devoured seven fat ears. Pharaoh\\'s wise men were unable to interpret these dreams, but the chief cup bearer remembered Joseph and spoke of his skill to Pharaoh. Joseph was called for, and interpreted the dreams as foretelling that seven years of abundance would be followed by seven years of famine, and advised Pharaoh to store surplus grain during the years of abundance. When the famine came, it was so severe that people from surrounding nations \"from all over the earth\" came to Egypt to buy bread as this nation was the only Kingdom prepared for the seven year drought.  In the second year of famine, Joseph\\'s half brothers were sent to Egypt, by their father Israel, to buy goods. When they came to Egypt, they stood before the Vizier but did not recognize him to be their brother Joseph. However, Joseph did recognize them and did not receive them kindly, rather he disguised himself and spoke to them in the Egyptian language using an interpreter. He did not speak at all to them in his native tongue, Hebrew. After questioning them as to where they came from, he accused them of being spies. They pleaded with him that their only purpose was to buy grain for their family in the land of Canaan. After they mentioned that they had left a younger brother at home, the Vizier  demanded that he be brought to Egypt as a demonstration of their veracity. This brother was Joseph\\'s blood brother, Benjamin. He placed his brothers in prison for three days. On the third day, he brought them out of prison to reiterate that he wanted their youngest brother brought to Egypt to demonstrate their veracity. The brothers conferred amongst themselves speaking in Hebrew, reflecting on the wrong they had done to Joseph. Joseph understood what they were saying and removed himself from their presence because he was caught in emotion. Joseph sent the brothers back with food but kept one brother, and the remaining brothers returned to their father in Canaan, and told him all that had transpired in Egypt. They also discovered that all of their money sacks still had money in them, and they were dismayed. Then they informed their father that the Vizier demanded that Benjamin be brought before him to demonstrate that they were honest men.After they had consumed all of the grain that they brought back from Egypt, Israel told his sons to go back to Egypt for more grain. With Reuben and Judah\\'s persistence, they persuaded their father to let Benjamin join them for fear of Egyptian retribution.Upon their return to Egypt, the brothers were afraid because of the returned money in their money sacks. Then when they get there Joseph reveals to them that he is in fact their brother, Joseph. Then has their father Jacob brought so they are all reunited in Egypt',\n",

       "  'The film opens with a prologue describing how the barons of England, aided by the Knights Templar, rebelled against King John in a war that lasted three years and ended with King John signing Magna Carta , a document granting equal rights to all Englishmen and reducing the power of the monarchy. Not long afterwards, he breaks his word and begins a bloody campaign of revenge against the barons who humiliated him, commanding an army of Danish mercenaries to whose leader he has promised that the Pope would keep his missionaries out of Denmark. The abbot Marcus, leading three Templar knights who have taken vows of silence, shelters from a storm at Darnay Castle on his way to Canterbury for pilgrimage. Abbot Marcus speaks with Thomas Marshall, one of the knights and promises he will secure Marshall\\'s release from the Templar Order once they reach Canterbury. The next morning, King John arrives with his Danish army and overruns the castle. John orders Darnay hanged, and Abbot Marcus has his tongue cut out by the Danes when he tries to intervene. Marshall and the two other knights fight the Danes, during which Marshall manages to escape the castle on horseback, carrying the abbot, while the other two knights are slain. The abbot dies of his wounds shortly after, and Marshall breaks his vow of silence to swear that his sacrifice will not be in vain. Once he has reached Canterbury, Marshall meets with Archbishop Langton, the author of the Magna Carta, and Baron William d\\'Aubigny, a former soldier turned wool merchant. Langton reveals that the Pope has sided with King John and that he himself is to be excommunicated for writing the Great Charter. The three men agree that John must be stopped, and that the place to do it is Rochester Castle, a strategically important stronghold that controls the route from southern England.  Aubigny persuades three of his men to join him, including his squire Guy, but a fourth turns down the baron\\'s call to arms. A party of seven finally leaves for Rochester where, on arriving, they discover six of the King Danish mercenaries have already claimed the castle after the fourth man had betrayed them to the king. Aubigny\\'s party fights and kills the Danish scouts and then claims Rochester Castle in the name of the rebellion, much to the displeasure of Baron Cornhill, its lord. When John\\'s army finally arrives and lays siege to Rochester, the garrison holds fast and manages to beat back the initial Danish assault. In the aftermath, Aubigny offers his men the chance to leave if they wish; none accept. For the second assault the Danes build a siege tower, but the defenders destroy it with a makeshift trebuchet and the attackers are repulsed again. The King\\'s army holds back and begins to starve the defenders out. The Archbishop is informed that Prince Louis is biding his time in France and negotiating with John, and sets off immediately to expedite affairs. As weeks become months and the hunger and suffering of the castle\\'s occupants increase, Marshall leaves under cover of night and steals food from the Danish camp, making it back just ahead of his pursuers. The defenders\\' morale is bolstered for the first time in months, and Marshall finally succumbs to the advances of Cornhill\\'s wife Isabel, breaking his Templar vows. The Danish leader, Tiberius, under pressure from John to take the castle or risk the King reneging on their bargain, adopts a different approach in his next assault and manages to sneak a small force of men over the walls before dawn to open the castle gates from within. Guy discovers the infiltrators and sounds the alarm, but it is too late. Tiberius leads the charge into the castle grounds while his Danes slaughter the garrison. During the chaos d\\'Aubigny is wounded and left behind in the chaos of the retreat. Marshall recovers in time to don his knight\\'s battle armor and charge the Danes on his war-horse, buying time for the survivors to pull back to the keep. Aubigny is dragged before the King and forced to watch as the hands of two prisoners are chopped off. After a defiant verbal exchange with John, he is subjected to the same fate and then killed by being flung from the makeshift trebuchet against the keep walls. Cornhill tries to surrender but after being stopped, he goes upstairs to his bedroom and hangs himself instead. John\\'s royal engineers then collapse part of the keep after tunneling under its foundations, and the final assault begins. The last defenders are killed except Guy, Isabel and Marshall, knocked unconscious by rubble from the keep\\'s collapse. Guy goes out to die fighting where he encounters Tiberius and is almost killed until a recovered Marshall intervenes. Tiberius challenges Marshall to single combat, and Marshall triumphs after an exhausting duel. Horns are heard in the distance as the combined English rebel and French army arrives at last, and John and the remaining Danes disperse in panic. Marshall meets Prince Louis and Archbishop Langton at the castle gates; the latter tells him that he is now free of the Templar Order. Acknowledging England\\'s new king with a nod, Marshall rides off with Isabel, while Guy tells his dead baron that \"We held\". The film ends with an epilogue describing King John\\'s death during his retreat and the reconstruction of Rochester Castle, and how it, like the Magna Carta, still stands today.',\n",

       "  ' The cartoon opens on a golf course. As the camera pans across the course, we see Tom trying to hit a ball out of a giant divot, and finally hits the ball out on his 50th attempt. When Tom takes the flag out of the hole, the ball promptly drops itself in...and quickly bounces out. Tom is surprised by this, and lifts the green, rolling the ball into the hole. When the ball is thrown out again, he putts. After it is thrown out again, the cat shoves the ball into the hole and pounds the end of his club in after it, and the ball promptly whacks into the cat\\'s eye. It is then revealed that Jerry lives in the hole on the golf course, and he was the one throwing the ball out. Jerry looks at Tom and draws an eyeball on the golf ball, which enrages the cat and causes him to swing at the mouse; his club misses and wraps around Tom\\'s own neck. Jerry escapes temporarily, but is caught when Tom hits his golf ball onto Jerry\\'s head, knocking him silly. The next scene shows that Jerry is being used as a tee and Tom places a ball on his head. Tom then readies his shot, which cuts out a huge divot while Jerry simply held onto Tom\\'s club and the ball. Tom looks far off into the distance to see where his ball is, but Jerry whistles and holds up the ball. Tom then puts Jerry through the ball cleaner, and the mouse responds by spitting soapy water in Tom\\'s face. Jerry is then forced into holding the tee with the ball on it; Tom hits the ball and poses with his teeth showing, which proves to be a mistake when the ball hits a huge boulder and bounces directly back the way it came, and it shatters all his teeth above and all his teeth beneath. In the next scene, Tom\\'s ball is in front of two skinny, long trees. Tom cannot stand behind his ball to hit it, so he is forced to split the trees to hit his ball. The trees smash his head, apparently decapitating him, and Tom\\'s body walks around and stands directly under it, somehow reattaching the head to the body. The ball ends up in a tree and triggers a \"slot machine\" display on the trunk. Three lemons appear on the reels, so Tom peeks inside the trunk, and an avalanche of golf balls comes out of the tree, tripping the cat. Annoyed at this, Tom returns to his game, but Jerry has replaced his ball with a woodpecker egg. After Tom hits the egg, the egg hatches and the bird comes back to peck on Tom\\'s head, pecking out the blade of the golf club such that the head lands on Tom\\'s head. Tom tries to hit another ball, but Jerry has hollowed it out such that it goes nowhere. Tom then places the shell on the chuckling Jerry\\'s head and swings at the ball-mouse, which lands right next to the hole. Jerry, with the ball still on his head, dizzily prances around the hole, and Tom pokes him in after making sure that nobody is looking. Tom then takes out his scorecard and tries to figure out his score for the hole. He writes down 3 in his card , but Jerry scolds him and Tom writes 33 instead. When Tom tees off on the next hole, Jerry ties the club to Tom\\'s tail; Tom ends up flying into the hole, leaving only his head exposed. Jerry sets up a putt and hits the ball toward Tom\\'s mouth, then whacks the cat on the head, forcing Tom to scream in pain and swallow the ball. Jerry runs away and the incensed cat emerges from the hole, but continually runs into his own clubs. Tom then swings a ball toward Jerry with some English on it, which scoops up the mouse and brings him back to Tom. Tom swings, which sends a tiny divot with ball and mouse through the air. Jerry uses the divot like a B-52 and drops the golf ball towards Tom like a bomb. Tom digs a trench to protect himself, but the ball opens to reveal a smaller black ball, which explodes. Meanwhile, Jerry\\'s divot crashes into a tree which Tom pokes at with the club; in response, the mouse grabs the club and pokes back. Tom then climbs into the tree and Jerry spanks the cat with the club, which causes the cat to peek out at the other end of the tree where a beehive is hanging. The bumblebees swarm around Tom\\'s head, and he slowly realizes the situation, dives into and out of the tree, and hides in a bush. Jerry, not to be denied the pleasure of humiliating the cat, runs the bush over with a lawn mower revealing Tom shaved like a French Poodle. The bumblebees then chase Tom over a lake hazard, where a stick of bamboo is seen; Tom hides under the water and is using the stick of bamboo like a snorkel, so he can hide underwater where the bumblebees cannot reach him. Jerry then whistles to get the bumblebees\\' attention, turns a \\'150 yds.\\' sign around to say Guess Who? and points it at the bamboo stalk. The queen bee looks through the bamboo stick to see Tom, who spits water in her face. Enraged,the queen leads the swarm on a bombing run down the stick. Jerry then places a funnel on top of the bumblebees to assist them in dive-bombing through the stick and into Tom\\'s mouth. The water is shown for a few seconds, with a drum roll playing, and then all the water flies into the sky for a moment. Tom jumps out and lets out a frightening and loud scream. Jerry then takes a driver and hits a long drive, which hits Tom square on the head from a far distance, knocking him out. Repeated in Mouse Cleaning.',\n",

Coy LaHood finds out about the Preacher through his son and instead of killing the preacher, out of fear of making him a martyr among the pan handlers, decides to try to bribe him with money and a church in hopes he will leave the camp, but the Preacher refuses. The Preacher asks if LaHood would be willing to buy the miners out and gets a final offer of $1,000 per claim. If the miners don\\'t leave within 24 hours, LaHood will hire a corrupt Marshal named Stockburn to clear them out. The miners initially want to take the offer, and ask the Preacher for his advice. He offers little, but Hull reminds them why they came, and what they have sacrificed. The miners decide to stay and fight. The next morning, however, the Preacher deserts the miners, leaving them scared and alone without any help. Megan, who has grown fond of the Preacher, also heads out looking for him, but Josh captures her and attempts to rape her. Club sees what is happening and disapproves, and so moves forward to help her before Josh can do anything serious. However, at this moment the Preacher arrives on horseback, armed with a Remington revolver, and shoots Josh in the hand. The Preacher takes Megan back to her mother in the mining camp. Stockburn arrives and he and his gang gun down one of the miners, Spider, who was drunkenly excoriating LaHood from the street. LaHood describes the Preacher to Stockburn, and Stockburn says that he sounds like someone that he once knew, but can\\'t be, because that man is dead. The Preacher teams up with Hull and they go to LaHood\\'s mining facility and blow it up with dynamite. In the chaos, Josh LaHood attempts to shoot the Preacher in the back but is stopped by Club out of respect for the Preacher. To stop Hull from following him into battle, the Preacher scared off Hull\\'s horse. The Preacher headed alone into town where he kills all but two of Coy\\'s thugs. Stockburn then sends his deputies after the Preacher, who shoots all of them one by one throughout town. The Preacher approaches Stockburn and only when he is a few feet away does Stockburn recognize him, crying \"You! YOU!\" Stockburn reaches for his gun, but the Preacher draws first and empties his gun into Stockburn. As a dying Stockburn tries to raise his gun, the Preacher retrieves backup pistol and finishes off Stockburn with a shot to the forehead. Coy Lahood, watching from a nearby store, aims a rifle at the Preacher, but Hull comes in the back door and kills Coy. The Preacher rides his horse out of a barn. He looks at Hull, who is surveying the remains of the battle and mutters to him, \"Long walk.\" Hull responds with a simple, \"Yep.\" The Preacher smirks and rides off into the Sierra Nevada Mountains. Megan gets to the town, but the Preacher has already left. As he rides off into the mountains, Megan cries out to him from the town shouting her thanks and words of love.',\n",
       "  \"Quadriplegic forensics expert Lincoln Rhyme  and a patrol cop, Amelia Donaghy , team up to solve a string of murders all connected to a serial killer by his signature: a single shard of bone is removed from each of the victims. Rhyme communicates with Amelia via phone as she examines the various crime scenes and collects evidence and reports back to him. The killer poses as a New York taxi driver, and abducts and kills those who get in his taxi. The first two victims are a married couple named Alan and Lindsay Rubin, who get a taxi home but then find themselves kidnapped by the killer. Amelia finds Alan's body buried in a Civil War-era railroad bed. She also finds a piece of shellfish, which eventually leads Amelia - now working with Rhyme - to Alan's wife, and a scrap of paper. The detectives find Mrs. Rubin, too late, at a steam junction in a below ground services area of a building in the financial district, secured using old handcuffs or shackles at the mouth of a pipe which emits steam. She has been scalded to death from the steam. The killer has also removed a bit of flesh and bone from her arm. Amelia finds another scrap of paper at the scene. The killer then abducts an NYU student. He is taken to a derelict slaughterhouse where he is tied to a pole and gutted with a knife, and left for rats to feed on. Amelia and Rhyme, using the clue left by the killer at the scene of Lindsay Rubin's death , find the victim, but again too late to save him. Again, the killer has removed a piece of the victim's bone. Amelia is able to collect the evidence, including another scrap of paper. The pressure of the tense investigation and bureaucratic challenges to both Amelia's and Rhyme's involvement with the case are having serious impacts on Rhyme's health and stability. After piecing together the message the killer was sending using the scraps of paper, Amelia and Rhyme are led to an old book of short stories, which in turn leads them to the killer's next victims, a grandfather and granddaughter tied to a pier as the tide rises. The girl is rescued, but her grandfather dies. At the scene, Amelia finds another bone, an old police badge, and an old subway map. These clues, and an earlier clue left by the killer at the scene of Mrs Rubin's death  lead Amelia to an abandoned subway station, in which Amelia sees some numbers which have been tampered with to spell out Rhyme's police badge number. Amelia then figures out that the killer is after Rhyme. The killer arrives at Rhyme's house, and after killing Rhyme's nurse, Thelma , and Captain Howard Cheney , it is revealed that he is the medical technician who cares for Rhyme's medical equipment. The technician, Richard Thompson , is an ex-forensic cop who wants revenge against Rhyme, whose testimony helped convict the killer of planting false evidence at crime scenes. Rhyme manages to crush Thompson's right hand by suddenly dropping his bed horizontal, and in struggle to free himself, Thompson pulls Rhyme with him and they both collapse to the floor. Rhyme then manages to bite Thompson in the neck, causing massive bleeding. Thompson once again manages to free himself. As Thompson raises a rather large scalpel for a killing blow, Amelia suddenly arrives at the apartment and shoots Thompson dead, saving Rhyme's life. The film ends at a Christmas celebration at Rhyme's apartment. Rhyme, having given up his plans to commit suicide, faces his sister and niece coming to visit him along with Amelia and his other colleagues on Christmas Eve.\",\n",

While buying books for his studies, Kid\\'s tuition cheque bounces and he is sent to the finance office where first he meets Miles, the Dean\\'s assistant who tells him not to be intimidated. Kid calls Play  about his money and Play quickly assures him that his money is in a safe place. Back on campus, Kid then meets Dean Kramer who destroys Kid\\'s student ID and gives him a week to pay his tuition fee. Miles tells Kid he can \"hook him up\" with an extension by getting his friend to make changes on the main computer for a small price. Kid gives Miles all the money he has left for the hook up. Meanwhile, Shelia Landreaux approaches Play after Rick apparently takes off with the money that was supposedly for Kid n\\' Play\\'s demo session so he can clear his gambling debts. Play hesitantly gives Shelia Kid\\'s scholarship cheque and faces a grilling from Bilal. Kid arrives later on demanding answers from Play as to the whereabouts of his money. Play comes clean to Kid and convinces him to ride to the recording studio where he promises Shelia will be with the money. Kid, Play and Bilal arrive at \"Do Me Records\" but are denied access into the building as the secretary has not heard of the names Shelia Landreaux or Play. Play is then confronted by Stab, Zilla and Pee Wee who want to know when they are going to record their demo. The trio were led to believe that Shelia gave Play their money for their demo session. As everyone argues the police arrive and warn them never to give money to any women by the name of Shelia Landreaux who also goes by several other alias\\'. Kid and Play get into a fight and Bilal then convinces Kid to ask Sydney for money. Kid tries to approache Sydney but Sydney assumes that he wants to break up with her.

However, Play and Bilal run amok on campus such as Bilal having sex with a stranger girl and Kid walking in on Play and Salena in his dorm. Play wants to hold the party in the faculty dining hall which would mean Kid having to get the key and risk getting into trouble with his boss Mr Lee. Kid is against this idea and instead tries to reconcile with Sydney but sees her getting close to Miles at a protest rally. After Mr Lee is informed that Kid is no longer a student he is dismissed of his duties and sent back to Dean Kramer. Kid manages to get his deadline extended another week giving him enough time to plan for the party. Kid, Play, Bilal and Jamal begin spreading word on campus about the party.

Kid finally confronts Miles on the roof who tries to swing at Kid but falls through the glass roof and lands flat in huge cake. The party is eventually stopped by Dean Kramer and the police. Miles tries to escape but he is caught by Stab, Zilla, and Pee-Wee. The police try to arrest them but Play explains the whole situation to Dean Kramer, who promptly fires Miles and has Rick and Shelia arrested instead. He then tells Kid that the room needs to be changed back to the way it was by morning or face expulsion. As Kid, Play, Bilal and Jamal frantically clean up Kid is approached by Mr Lee. A reluctant Play gives Kid the money they made and Kid hands it over to Mr Lee hoping it will pay for the damages. The next day Kid informs Mr Lee and then Professor Sinclair of his departure citing that he hadn\\'t proven he belonged at college. Professor Sinclair had thought otherwise revealing he had given Kid an A minus for his 20 page paper. He offers Kid a job as his teaching assistant but Kid declines because it wouldn\\'t cover all his expenses. Kid heads over to Pops grave where he apologizes for letting him down. Play attempts to talk to Kid but he is too upset. Kid then packs up the rest of his stuff and says goodbye to Jamal and Sydney. He also finally wins the respect of Stab, Zilla and Pee Wee. They ride pass and tell him they got a job working on the police force. Play and Bilal pull up with their girlfriends in Play\\'s old car. Play sold \"Foreplay\" and gives the money to Kid. He admits to being the one who forced Kid to drop out of college in the first place and apologizes. Play tells Kid to go back inside and study. As Play and Bilal drive away, Kid looks up to the heavens and says thanks to Pop.',\n",

       "  \"The title refers to both a pub landlord's last call and the final wishes of a dying man, in this instance Jack Dodds , an east London butcher who greatly influenced four men over the course of his flawed but decent lifetime. The quartet gathers to scatter Jack's ashes in Margate, where he had hoped to retire to a small seaside cottage with his wife Amy , a dream that never was fulfilled. The four are professional horse race gambler Ray Johnson , aka Lucky, who fought beside Jack during World War II and has been his best friend since; former boxer Lenny , who is always ready to settle an argument with his fists; undertaker Vic , who acts as a buffer of sorts; and Jack's son Vince , a dealer of used luxury cars, whose relationship with his father never quite recovered when, as a young boy, he learned his real family perished in a wartime bombing and Jack and Amy took in the orphaned infant and raised him as their own. As the quartet journeys from London by car to honour Jack's request, with stops at Canterbury Cathedral, the Chatham Naval Memorial, the hop farm where Jack and Amy met, and a couple of pubs en route, they reminisce about their friend and recall their personal interactions with him over the years. Meanwhile, Amy is on a journey of her own to visit their mentally retarded daughter June , who has been institutionalized since shortly after her birth fifty years earlier. Over the years Jack barely acknowledged her existence, but Amy faithfully has visited her weekly, even though June has no idea of who she is or why she's there. Through frequent flashbacks that stretch across six decades, the stories of the events that brought these people to this point in their lives slowly unfold, ultimately revealing the importance of friendship and love.\",\n",

Despite his amazing scores in the acceptance tests, Max is denied the promotion because the Chief  of CONTROL feels that Max\\'s analytical skills are best used for his present assignment. When CONTROL headquarters is attacked by the terrorist organization KAOS, led by Siegfried , almost all of CONTROL\\'s agents\\' identities are exposed, leaving only Max and Agent 99 , whose recent plastic surgery has protected her identity, to pursue the culprits while former field operatives are demoted to desk jobs. Max is promoted to field agent as Agent 86, but the experienced 99 is reluctant to partner him because of his clumsy personality. Before he leaves HQ, two of Max\\'s friends from the lab give him an unusual Swiss Army Knife which not only has the standard equipment, but also comes with a flamethrower and a crossbow that fires harpoons. Max and 99 enter Russia by parachute, hoping to trace KAOS\\' recent acquisition of nuclear materials through its chief bomb maker, Krstic. Along the way, they are attacked by Dalip , one of Siegfried\\'s henchman. By infiltrating a luxurious party hosted by Krstic, they trace the nuclear material to a KAOS nuclear weapons factory disguised as a Moscow bakery, but when Krstic and his men corner them, Max is forced to shot him. In the bakery, Max meets with Siegfried and his second-in-command, Shtarker, only to learn that Siegfried was expecting him because a double-agent has compromised his and 99\\'s identities. Max manages to escape capture and bombs the weapons factory. During their escape, Max and 99 are confronted by Dalip. Realizing that he knows Dalip through hours of listening to him on spy \\'chatter\\', Max manages to persuade Dalip to spare their lives by giving him advice on how to repair his failing marriage. The Chief sends 23 to observe the clean-up of the factory, but KAOS manages to sneak the weapons out through the Moskva River, so 23 report\\'s that only a bakery has been destroyed. Realizing that Max was alone during his key discoveries, CONTROL believe Max to be the double-agent. 99, who has been gradually falling in love with Max, is heartbroken but takes Max into custody. CONTROL\\'s warning is disregarded when Siegfried threatens to release nuclear weapon detonator codes to rogue states unless the United States government pays him $200&nbsp;billion. While Max is in a CONTROL holding cell, Dalip sends him a coded message via the radio show American Top 40 revealing Siegfried\\'s plan: to detonate a nuclear device during the President\\'s visit to a concert performed at the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles. Max escapes from CONTROL and flies to Los Angeles to unite with the Chief, 99, and 23, who have flown out to persuade the President to take the KAOS threat seriously. Although 23 is skeptical, Max manages to convince 99 and the Chief that he is not the double-agent. As KAOS plants the nuclear bomb in the concert hall, Max\\'s Geiger counter-equipped watch beeps when he is near 23, picking up trace elements of radiation. Max questions him as to why he would have radiation on him if he said the bakery was clean. He also points out that 23\\'s knife wound is seeping blood, which 23 had previously said happens when his blood pressure rises, concluding that 23 is the double-agent. 23 then pulls out a gun, takes 99 hostage and flees in a vehicle. While chasing after 23, Max explains to the Chief about why can\\'t get over the fact that 23 is a traitor while the Chief constantly warns Max of obstacles ahead. Crashing into a golf course, the car is littered with golf balls, while hitting a sand trap, a golf tractor and a snack shack. The car hit the shack, flies through the air, and lands at the fence of an airport. They then hop onto a small plane with an advertisement on its tail. Max reaches 23\\'s car by jumping out of the plane and rescues 99, but in the struggle the car is set on fire  and forced onto railroad tracks. Max then follows 99\\'s example during the skydive and kisses 23 to distract him. After the kiss, the car collides with a freight train and 23 is killed. Max escapes certain death, \"missing it by that much\". After analyzing 23\\'s nuclear football, Max realizes that the bomb will be triggered by the final note of Beethoven\\'s \"Ode to Joy\". Max, 99, and the Chief manage to reach the concert hall, and Max tackles the conductor just before the final note. Siegfried, finding that his plan has failed, tells Dalip that he will not kill his wife for his failure, though he comments that he would be doing \"the sighted world a favor\" if he did. In response, Dalip throws him out the car door. Max is given honors and gets his dream of becoming a real spy with agent 99 as his girlfriend. The movie ends as Max and 99 exit CONTROL headquarters through a walkway. While the doors of the walkway close, the two notice that the last door did not close. Max attempts to fix it, but it closes on him. He drops his Swiss Army knife and it fires a harpoon at his cheeks.',\n",

After searching for a good, tough crime reporter for a fresh viewpoint, he appoints Johnny Jones  as a foreign correspondent, under the pen name \"Huntley Haverstock\". The reporter\\'s first assignment is Stephen Fisher , leader of the Universal Peace Party, at an event held by Fisher in honour of a Dutch diplomat named Van Meer . On the way to the party, Haverstock sees Van Meer entering the car which is to take him to the party, and runs to interview him; Van Meer invites him to ride along. At the party, Haverstock meets Fisher\\'s daughter, Carol . Van Meer disappears mysteriously. Later, Fisher informs the guests that Van Meer, who was supposed to be the guest of honor, will not be attending the party; instead he will be at a political conference in Amsterdam. At the conference, Van Meer is shot in front of a large crowd by a man disguised as a photographer. Haverstock commandeers a car to follow the assassin\\'s getaway car. The car he jumps into happens to have in it Carol and Scott ffolliott , another reporter, who explains that the capital letter in his surname was dropped in memory of an executed ancestor. The group follows the assassin to a windmill in the countryside. While Carol and ffolliott go for help, Haverstock searches the windmill and finds a live Van Meer&nbsp;– the man who was killed was an impostor. The old man is drugged and unable to tell him anything. Haverstock is forced to flee when the kidnappers become aware of him. By the time the police arrive, the villains have escaped with Van Meer in an airplane. Later, back at Haverstock\\'s hotel room, two spies dressed as policemen arrive to kidnap him. When he suspects who they really are, he escapes out the window and into Carol Fisher\\'s room. Haverstock and Carol board a British boat to England, and while a furious storm thunders overhead, he proposes to her. In England, the two go to Carol\\'s father\\'s house, where Haverstock sees a man whom he recognizes as one of the men at the windmill. He informs Fisher, but Fisher ignores him, saying that he will send a bodyguard to protect him. However, the bodyguard Rowley  repeatedly tries to kill Haverstock instead. When the assassin tries to push him off the top of the Westminster Cathedral tower, Haverstock steps aside just in time and Rowley plunges to his death instead.  Haverstock and ffolliott are convinced that Fisher is a traitor, so the two come up with a plan, with Haverstock taking Carol to the countryside, while ffolliott pretends she has been kidnapped to force Fisher to divulge Van Meer\\'s location. However, Haverstock and Carol argue, and she returns to London. Just as Fisher is about to fall for ffolliott\\'s bluff, he hears her car pull up. Ffolliott follows Fisher to a hotel where Van Meer is being held. Just as Van Meer is being forced to divulge the information the organization wants, ffolliott distracts the interrogators. When Haverstock arrives, Fisher and his bodyguards escape, leaving Van Meer behind. Van Meer is rushed to the hospital in a coma. In the meantime, England and France have declared war on Germany. Then, while the group are on a Short Empire plane to America, Fisher confesses his deeds to his daughter. Despite this, Carol blames Haverstock for not really loving her and only wanting to pursue her father. He protests that he was just doing his job as a reporter. Seconds later, the plane is shelled by a German destroyer and crashes into the ocean. The survivors perch on the floating wing of the downed plane. Realizing that it cannot support everyone, including his daughter, Fisher sacrifices himself by allowing himself to drown. Jones and ffolliott attempt to save him, but are unsuccessful. Shortly after, they are picked up by an American ship, the Mohican, from which, over the phone and over the objections of the captain who is concerned to maintain American neutrality, they relate their whole story. Later, back in London, Jones and Carol do a radio broadcast to the US, while London is being bombed, warning them about what Germany is doing.',\n",

Hector Street divides Two Mills by race: blacks on East End, whites on West End. The racial tensions are very strong. Maniac is confused by racial biases; to him, the people are simply people - heterogeneous, but with much in common, such as both kindness and cruelty. Jeffrey\\'s parents were killed by a drunk driver just after his father told him that he would show him his infamous \"stopball.\" After his parents\\' funeral, a couple tells Jeffery to \"come with them.\" Maniac taught himself to fly and learns how to run. After one year of running, Jeffrey arrives in Two Mills and quickly befriends people on both sides of the unofficial segregation line.

He also meets James Down  a football player impressed by Jeffrey\\'s own speed, dexterity, and agility. Later, the racial intolerance he encounters prompts Jeffrey to realize that the Beale family is different than he is. As a result, he flees the town and hides in the buffalo enclosure of the local zoo. The buffaloes, a mother and a calf, accept Jeffrey as one of their own. One day, he starts to live in a gymnasium on the premises, creating a nearly utopian life of interdependence and mutual learning. Jeffrey learns that Grayson, a groundskeeper at the zoo, was once a Minor League baseball player, forced to retire after a spectacular failure that came in the wake of a sequence of victories. Grayson, in turn, learns to read, a skill he had neglected through childhood. After Christmas, Grayson dies in his sleep. Jeffrey, heartbroken, flees to Valley Forge and there waits to die.

John is a tall bully who was humiliated in a baseball game by Jeffrey, who was the only kid who could hit John\\'s fastballs. For returning the younger duo, John forgives Jeffrey and takes him home. In the McNab house, Jeffrey sees gluttony, squalor, racial prejudice, and sloth. Due to struggles that result from his unique social position — that of a homeless integrator — Jeffrey leaves the McNabs and roams all over the town, sleeping where he might and running at his own great pace through the streets in the early morning. During his runs, he sees Mars Bar again, who also runs early in the morning. The two run next to each other in silence, acknowledging one another through looks but not words.

       "  'In the 26th century, humanity has left an overpopulated Earth and moved to a new solar system, colonizing many planets and moons. The Alliance has won a war with the less established planets of outer star systems. A young girl named River Tam is the most promising of a number of young people being mentally and physically conditioned by Alliance scientists. Rescued by her brother Simon, the two find refuge aboard the Firefly-class transport ship Serenity, captained by Malcolm \"Mal\" Reynolds. An Alliance agent, the Operative, is tasked with neutralizing River, as she has been visited by high Alliance politicians and may have learned certain top secrets due to her psychic abilities. Aboard Serenity, Mal takes River along on a bank robbery against her brother\\'s objections. They are attacked by another group of raiders: Reavers, animalistic humans who savagely eat their victims alive. They escape, but Simon decides that he and River will leave Serenity at the next port. While Mal meets fences Fanty and Mingo at a bar, a TV commercial causes River to attack the patrons with superbly effective martial arts. Before she can shoot Mal, Simon arrives and shouts a \"safe word\" which causes her to fall asleep. Mal carries River back to Serenity, but the incident is captured on camera. The crew contacts a reclusive hacker known as Mr. Universe who analyzes the commercial and discovers a subliminal message being broadcast across Alliance space designed to trigger River. He notes that River whispered \"Miranda\" before attacking. Mal receives a call from Inara, a former passenger. Suspecting a trap but fearing she is in danger, Mal goes to her and is confronted by the Operative. The Operative offers to let Mal go free if he turns River over, but thanks to Inara\\'s quick thinking, she and Mal escape. After another of River\\'s outbursts, the crew discover that Miranda is a remote planet thought to have been rendered uninhabitable as the result of a terraforming accident. Serenity returns to Haven, a mining colony and home of Shepherd Book, a former passenger and friend. They discover, however, that the outpost has been destroyed and the residents slaughtered. The Operative has ordered the deaths of all of Mal\\'s contacts to deny him a safe haven and promises that he will continue to pursue them until he gets River. The way to Miranda is blocked by a region swarming with Reavers, so Mal disguises Serenity as a Reaver ship. After sailing through a fleet of Reaver vessels, the crew discovers a habitable planet, but only corpses strew its cities. They discover a log recorded by an Alliance survey team explaining that the Alliance administered a chemical designed to suppress aggression in the residents, which worked too well, making them so passive they stopped working, stopped reproducing, and eventually simply laid down and died of dehydration. However, 0.1% of the population instead reacted by becoming hyper-aggressive and unstable, explaining the origin of the Reavers. Mal contacts Mr. Universe to arrange to have the log broadcast to everyone, but the Operative is already there and has Mr. Universe lure them in. Mal knows Serenity is heading into a trap, so he opens fire on one of the Reaver ships. The Reavers pursue Serenity to Mr. Universe\\'s planet where they engage the waiting Alliance fleet. The Operative\\'s ship is destroyed, but he survives in an escape pod. Serenity is damaged by a pursuing Reaver ship, but manages to crash land. Pilot Wash is killed by the Reavers. Finding Mr. Universe dead and his equipment wrecked, Mal learns of a secret backup transmitter from a message recorded by the dying Mr. Universe. The crew makes a stand against the Reavers to buy Mal the time to send the message. After a firefight, the crew retreat behind a set of blast doors, but the doors only partially close. Zoe and Kaylee are wounded. Simon discovers he has left his medical kit behind; as he rises to retrieve it, he is shot. He apologizes to River for failing her. She replies that it is her turn to take care of him. She charges through the opening in the blast doors, triggers the closing mechanism and throws the medical kit to Simon before the Reavers drag her away. Mal reaches the transmitter, but The Operative is close behind. In hand-to-hand combat, Mal manages to disable his opponent and bind him to a railing, forcing him to watch the recording. Mal returns to his crew. The blast doors open to reveal that River has dispatched all of the Reavers. The wall behind her explodes, and Alliance troops rush in. The Operative, realizing he has been lied to by the government, orders his men to stand down. After the crew erect memorials to their dead friends on Mr. Universe\\'s moon, they patch up Serenity. Kaylee and Simon consummate their relationship. The disillusioned Operative tells Mal that the Alliance government has been weakened and that he will try his best to present his former foe in the best light, but cannot guarantee that others will not be sent after Mal and his crew. Serenity lifts off with River as Mal\\'s new copilot.',\n",

Later, Hui unknowingly faces new trouble when a genius businessman, Danny Poon  opens what is to be the first of a chain of Danny\\'s Chicken fast food fried chicken restaurants across the street from him.

       "  \"Charles Reece  is a serial killer who commits a number of brutal mutilation-slayings in order to drink blood as a result of paranoid delusions. Reece is soon captured. Most of the movie revolves around the trial and the prosecutor's attempts to have Reece found sane and given the death penalty. Defense lawyers, meanwhile, argue that the defendant is not guilty by reason of insanity. The prosecutor, Anthony Fraser , was previously against capital punishment, but he seeks such a penalty in the face of Reece's brutal crimes after meeting one victim's grieving family. In the end, Reece is found sane and given the death penalty, but Fraser's internal debate about capital punishment is rendered academic when Reece is found to be insane by a scanning of his brain for mental illness. In the ending of the original version of the film, Reece is found dead in his cell, having overdosed himself on antipsychotics he had been stockpiling. In the ending of the revised version, Reece is sent to a state mental hospital, and in a chilling coda, he sends a letter to a person whose wife and child he has killed, asking the man to come and visit him. A final title card reveals that Reece is scheduled for a parole hearing in six months.\",\n",

       "  \"The beginning starts with the Masterson family being murdered. The mother puts away a bloody knife, leaves a baby to drown in the bathtub with the water running, writes a note, and then shoots herself in the mouth with a pistol. Twenty years later, ghost hunter Carter Simms is offered $5,000 to stay a weekend in the Masterson house to investigate paranormal activity. The owner of the house also hires help for Carter, which include Colin Green as the videographer and Yvette Sandoval as a journalist. Together they set up equipment to help find and investigate any evidence of ghosts or paranormal activity. The group is then joined by Mary Young Mortensen, a young member of the Mastersons' church. She claims she was also sent by owner of the house to assist in the investigation. She also states that she is there to protect the reputations of the Mastersons because they were great members of their church. The group stays in the Masterson house for three days. Several mysterious things happen: the room temperature in the master bedroom lowers dramatically in a short period; a chair moves on its own; a gunshot and mysterious voices are recorded and some ghostly figures are recorded on video. By the beginning of day three, Colin gets a call from the owner of the house and it turns out Mary Young Mortensen was never supposed to be at the house; so Carter forces Mary to leave. Later that night, nothing much is happening, but the group reviews a video tape and sees a figure in the guest house. As they are going to investigate the guest house, we flash to a scene where Mary is on a radio talk show concerned about the people out to discredit the good name of the Mastersons. She convinces herself she needs to stop them and returns to the house. Mary then begins killing all members of the group, writes a note, and commits suicide much like the mother did in the opening scenes of the movie. It turns out Mary was the small child left by the mother in the opening scene. She was rescued before she drowned and apparently adopted by the first officer to arrive on the scene. As Mary is preparing for her suicide, she tells the sordid story of the Mastersons, involving the imprisonment, rape and torture of her mother who eventually became pregnant with her. The birth of Mary caused Mrs. Masterson to kill her family and Mary's mother. As the movie ends, it switches to a scene where Carter is seen looking at and in to a infrared camera. It turns out she is now a ghost in the house, unable to leave along with the other ghosts.\",\n",

Meanwhile, HP and Sanderson find the child, and decide to transform him into their \"ultimate weapon\" for their next 37-year plan. 37 years later, in the present day, Timmy and the children of Dimmsdale begin the first day of summer vacation , having fun, along with the pixies making it more fun but also destroying the city. Meanwhile, the parents complain to the mayor that their kids could get hurt and Flappy Bob appears and offers a solution: to send all the kids to his Camp Learn-a-Torium, an overprotective and over-educational daycare center where they will be kept for the entire summer, while the parents enjoy . The Pixies appear to Timmy and suggest to him that the camp, and boredom and restriction in general, can be blamed solely on adults, a notion to which Timmy agrees . Timmy wishes for kids to be the ruling class in the world, and after an interlude in which the Pixies delight at their plan\\'s progress , Timmy reflects on life as President while Cosmo and Wanda complain that they are stuck with the chores . The Pixies remind Jorgen von Strangle of the loophole that allows them God-parental custody over Flappy Bob, and point out that with their newfound power, the children of the world no longer need fairies. To make the takeover of Fairy World complete, the Pixies convince Flappy Bob to sign a contract that allows him total control over what the world considers fun, in exchange for control of Fairy World being given to the Pixies. Jorgen now has no choice but to  to what used to be Fairy World.

Wanda finds Timmy nearly immediately, and Flappy Bob appears soon afterwards, decked out in full clown regalia. The three begin to form their plan, with Bob drawing on his business and law education in order to find a loophole while all three do their best to have fun and draw the ire of HP and Sanderson . On cue, the Pixies appear and remind Bob of the contract, and Bob takes the opportunity to point out the loophole and the Pixies quote... \"In return for making the world what we want... Yadda, yadda, yadda... We get the power... Yadda, yadda, yadda... ...Earth will be safe and fun as defined by Flappy Bob\".

Rita is a leisure girl whereas Nadeem works as a hotel receptionist and they both fall in love. The differences between Nadeem and Rita's father Seth  arises right from the beginning, esp. when he  criticised Nadeem for his social status and earning capacity, saying his daughter's sari costs 7,500 rupees as compare to his  monthly salary of 750 rupees. But after a struggle by Rita and a threat to her parents that she would suicide if she would not be allowed to marry Nadeem, her father agreed. So both married but Nadeem knew that Seth was not really happy with this marriage. One day Rita's mother  came to her daughter's house, located in a middle class, and offered Nadeem a job in Seth's friend's business firm, which he denied. Not only this, he also angried on Rita about the telephone  installed in his house by her. A few days later, Rita's mother purchased furniture for Nadeem's house  and invited her guests to a dance party in Nadeem's house. When Nadeem came back home, he became very angry and he asked Rita to leave the house and stay in her father's house. Rita left, with tears, Nadeem's house.

But her father deceived her too that he had visited Nadeem but he insulted him in front of his friends and said that he is going to divorce her. This shocked Rita to such an extent that she could not bear the pain of pregnancy. So they moved to a hospital in the same city where the Nadeem was gone for his new job.

In the hospital's lobby, he found his wife unconscious on the hospital bed, during this Seth interrupted and said that he is going to give away the child to an orphanage, but Nadeem refused to do that and said that he will take care of child himself. The film has taken a very sad turn at that point esp. when Nadeem carrying the baby to his house and singing the sad version of the song Mujhe dil se na bhulana... and remembering those happy days with Rita. On the other side, Seth lied not only to Rita but to his wife  also that the baby has died. This was a tremendeous shock for Rita and she somewhat lost her mental balance. After few years the baby is grown up to a teenage boy , a very sensitive and very anxious about his mother. Whereas, Rita's mental instability grew day by day, so her mother asked Rita's father to let Rita visit her baby's grave which would perhaps help her. Next day all visited  and searched the graveyard, where they come across the real baby , who was picking flowers there. As there was nothing to found there, they started leaving the place. During this Shahzeb immediately reached home and asked his father  about the features of his mother, Nadeem hand him over her photo. Shahzeb recognised his mother and ran towards the road where Rita and her parents come from and started singing the same song which he used to listen from his father Mujhe dil se na bhulana... Rita stopped the car and ran towards the place where the voice was coming from and finally she reached Nadeem's house. Amazed by the situation both asked about the divorce, as both were in misunderstanding, the truth revealed that it was Rita's father who had actually planned their separation  and who had lied to her that her child is dead. Rita turned angriely and slapped her embarrassed father, who was listening this.

Carla tells Ray, insisting this to be the end of their financial troubles, and although he is initially hesitant she finally persuades him to steal the money. Ray devises a plan. He will need to burn the house down so Smithy thinks the money was simply destroyed rather than stolen, a job for which he hires the local arsonist, Billy . Carla will first steal the money from the hiding place and then Billy will arrive and set a fire to make it look as though it was caused by faulty Christmas tree lights. While the whole town is at the Christmas celebration, Carla sneaks back to the house and takes the money from the duffel bag. However, on return she overhears Smithy phoning his mother and asking her to go to his house  and feed his dog. Carla alerts Ray who quickly tries to ring Billy, but is only able to reach his sister Lily . With his phone dying, Ray tells Lily to abort the plan but Lily is unable to alert Billy before he leaves. Billy breaks in and sets the fire, unaware of Smithy\\'s mum sleeping on the lounge. Consequently she dies in the ensuing blaze. Thus things begin to take a downward slide for Ray and Carla. Lily neglects to tell Billy about Ray\\'s call aborting the plan, causing Billy to think he has been duped unwillingly into murdering an old lady. Smithy, devastated by his mother\\'s death, then discovers that the money had, in fact, been stolen, and begins to search ruthlessly for the culprits. And Ray\\'s life is further complicated when someone starts sending him Christmas cards threatening to reveal \"what you\\'re up to\" unless a $10,000 blackmail is paid. What follows is a quickening spiral of murder, suspicion, violence and deceit with shocking consequences for the two lovers and everyone around them. Every time someone discovers something about Ray, they end up dead in some accident caused by Ray trying to stop them. The blackmailer is discovered to be Barney and his wife . Ray goes to Carla\\'s house so they can run off together only to find Billy. Billy demands the rest of his money and Carla gives him the bag full of money she and Ray were going to run away with. As Billy forces Ray and Carla on their knees, Smithy walks in and pulls a gun on Billy. In the fire exchange Smithy is killed and as Ray tries to take the gun from Billy, Carla is shot in the head. Billy leaves as Ray weeps over Carla\\'s body. Ray walks off down the road in shock from the events.',\n",

       "  'During a battle with Dr. Animo, Ben Kirby Tennyson\\'s destruction of the scientist\\'s \"DNA bomb\" accidentally sets off a self-destruct protocol in the Omnitrix. Its activation alerts Tetrax , who travels with his alien blob-like pilot Gluto to Earth in order to retrieve Ben. He explains the situation to Ben, who hasn\\'t figured out the meaning of the countdown. He leaves Gwen and Grandpa Max behind, not wanting the latter to be recognized during their trip. Gwen sneaks on board anyway. Using the advanced medical equipment on board his ship, Tetrax finds the DNA signature of the Omnitrix\\'s creator, Azmuth, and tracks him to a prison facility called Incarcecon. After staging a breakout, they free a female Chimera Sui Generis  named Myaxx, who is Azmuth\\'s assistant; she had switched her DNA signature for Azmuth\\'s when he refused to give her credit for helping to create the Omnitrix. Myaxx is also unable to disarm the self-destruct, which will not only kill Ben, but most of the universe\\'s inhabitants, including Earth itself, but Myaxx knows how to find Azmuth, and leads them to the planet he\\'s hiding out on: Xenon. Vilgax, who has also picked up on the Omnitrix\\'s self-destruct signal, picks up Sixsix . While attempting to reach Azmuth, they are attacked by Vilgax, who has escaped the Null Void and has commandeered a ship to track down Ben. Ben is ultimately successful in repelling the attack, though Gluto is killed in the conflict while protecting Gwen. Tetrax\\'s ship crashes on Azmuth\\'s homeworld. As they enter his mountain fortress, they are attacked by a group of Florauna  which capture Gwen. Ben is depressed, and blames himself. As Ben reluctantly proceeds with Tetrax and Myaxx down towards Azmuth\\'s lair, Tetrax empathizes with Ben, revealing his origins of how working for Vilgax cost him his whole planet and everyone he\\'s ever cared for. Tracking down Azmuth to a sealed secondary laboratory, Ben asks him to shut down the Omnitrix, but Azmuth, unconcerned about anything around him, refuses. Angry, Ben breaks down the wall with Cannonbolt and attacks him, revealing Azmuth to be an old, curmudgeonly Galvan  hiding inside a large mechanical suit. As far as Azmuth is concerned, the whole universe deserves whatever it gets for misusing the Omnitrix. He tells them the Omnitrix was designed to be the ultimate device of peace and understanding. Everyone else made it a problem, only seeing it as the ultimate weapon. Vilgax, having recovered from his earlier defeat, leads a massive attack on Azmuth\\'s mountain fortress. During the fight, Gwen and Gluto reappear, Ben runs over to hug Gwen and Gluto having regenerated from some leftover material that splashed on Gwen\\'s clothes and subsequently helping her to escape. Ben\\'s actions during the battle renew Azmuth\\'s faith in the universe, so he repairs the Omnitrix and gives Ben a brand-new form to use: Way Big, a skyscraper-sized alien modeled after Ultraman, who easily repels Vilgax\\'s army of drones and angrily tosses the villain into space. With the threat over, Ben offers to return the Omnitrix to Azmuth, who is leaving Xenon with Myaxx. Azmuth, however, sees Ben as the best place for the Omnitrix to be, both because he is technically fulfilling its original intention and because the Omnitrix attracts trouble simply by virtue of its existence. Tetrax returns Ben and Gwen to Earth, leaving Ben with a new hoverboard to replace the one Ben destroyed during his battle with Animo. The Tennysons\\' hope of having a normal day of recreation, however, is dashed by a newsflash of \\'zombies\\' attacking the mall, leading them to rush to the rescue.

       "  'The plot of the special differs significantly from the original book. The sequence in the book where the cat balances all sorts of objects on a ball, then crashes, is left out. Also differing is the role of Thing 1 and Thing 2; in the original book, they were simply things the cat brought along to demonstrate fun, but in this special, they are commissioned to help find the cat\\'s \"moss-covered three-handled family gradunza.\" The vocabulary used in the special is also of a much higher level than the book, though still in Seuss\\'s trademark rhyme. After the Cat makes his entrance and fools around a bit, the Fish requests that he leave. He does so, but then comes back in, claiming that his \"moss-covered three-handled family gradunza\" has been stolen, and he accuses the Fish, who is given the name Karlos K. Krinkelbein in the special. The Cat sings a ballad about the loss of his treasured keepsake and then tries to describe it to the kids, even though they don\\'t understand what he\\'s talking about. The Cat then leads the kids on a search through the house, using his method of \"Calculatus Eliminatus\", which involves writing marks on every place they\\'ve already checked. This makes a mess of everything, and Mr. Krinkelbein demands that the Cat leave once again, but it only prompts the Cat to sing another song, this one about feeling pessimistic and having low self-esteem . Then he proceeds to put the cynical fish to sleep by singing a lullaby. Once that\\'s done, he brings out Thing One and Thing Two, singing to the kids that they can find \"anything under the sun\", all the while the Things play sports using Mr. Krinkelbein\\'s fishbowl as the ball/puck.  Mr. Krinkelbein then becomes angry and accuses the Cat of not being a real Cat , and his hat of not being a real hat. This cues arguably the wackiest song in the special, where the Cat sings out his name in several languages . The song becomes so catchy that everyone, even Krinkelbein, joins in and contributes alternative translations for languages like \\'Eskimo\\' and Russian . Just as they finish up the song, though, they hear the mother coming home. The Cat then proceeds to clean up the house, just like in the book, using a motorized vehicle. Just as he leaves, the mother returns, telling the kids that she just saw a Cat in a Hat \"going down the street with a moss-covered three-handled family gradunza.\" This tends to suggest that the \"gradunza\" was a strange vehicle the Cat drove around the house as he cleaned it up; in any event, its exact nature remains a mystery to the viewer.',\n",

The audio segues from the ringing phone to a conversation with his father wherein his father urges him to get a job and then, as if to undercut his son\\'s confidence, offers to mail him a check.

When Mauser grabs it, it electrocutes him. On the final day of the cadet training/evaluation competition, one person from each school attends the governor\\'s ball.  Copeland and Blankes play with the computer system as cars are sent to wrong locations, but are caught by Hooks, who punches them out cold.

Mauser and Proctor prove to be too overconfident and ineffective to react to the emergency, but Lassard\\'s squad arrives in time to save the day and rescue the governor. As a result of the governor\\'s final judgement, Lassard\\'s school stays open, and the epilogue shows Lassard making a speech on how the academy is grateful for the \"many, many\" recruits.

       "  'Butters briefly hallucinates he is home, but finds he is still in Imaginationland. A variety of evil creatures, including monsters, horror movie murderers, and comic book super-villains burst through the destroyed barrier gates and kill the terrorists who freed them before turning their attention on the good creatures. The Mayor urges everyone to flee to the castle in the Gumdrop Forest. Before he can try to get Butters home, the Mayor himself is impaled by a Xenomorph. Before the Mayor dies, he tells Butters to go to Castle Sunshine and to watch out for the evil characters. Meanwhile Cartman has a dream concerning his frustration with Kyle NOT sucking his balls. Butters is then on the run from one evil character after another. When the evil characters have finally ended their rampage and argue about their next move, Butters ends up on the run with the Lollipop King and Snarf from Thundercats. The three encounter the evil creatures who have captured Strawberry Shortcake, and watch from a safe distance. The creatures assault, torment and jeer her and Jason Voorhees  gouges out one of her eyes. Just as a Minotaur orders them to kill her, the Woodland Christmas Critters from Cartman\\'s Christmas story appear, claiming they can do better – or rather, worse. They want to make her eat her eye, then give her AIDS by urinating in her eye socket, before raping and killing her. They set off to find some AIDS in the forest, much to the stunned surprise of the other evil characters who are horrified by how truly evil the critters are . Meanwhile, Kyle and Stan are being interrogated at The Pentagon. The kids learn of a portal into Imaginationland that had been built during the Cold War and is controlled by the government . The portal powers up when the boys sing the Mayor\\'s Imagination song which, as they soon find, is difficult to remember . Cartman breaks into the Pentagon and convinces the officials to let him drag Kyle away for the promised teabagging in the conference room. But Cartman gloats too long and an alarm interrupts them . The American government send in a group of soldiers and Kurt Russell into Imaginationland. They radio back information that they have found a group of \"talking woodland Christmas critters.\" Stan, remembering the critters from the Christmas story written by Cartman, quickly tries to warn them to flee, but the Woodland Critters gang rape the soldiers. A moment later, ManBearPig breaks through the portal into the Pentagon. He kills two workers and grabs Kyle by the neck. An injured employee manages to reverse the portal, sending ManBearPig back into it for good. Unfortunately, Stan is caught in the force of the portal\\'s power and is pulled in as well too. Due to the way ManBearPig held Kyle, he has been horribly injured, and is shortly pronounced dead when not even two zaps from a defibrillator get his heart going again. Despite wishing so many times of wanting Kyle dead, Cartman is completely horrified and furious by Kyle\\'s death, only because Kyle is escaping his obligation to suck his balls . Refusing to let Kyle die, Cartman performs CPR and slaps Kyle repeatedly, almost in tears. He manages to revive Kyle, who is put on oxygen and taken to a hospital, once again unaware that Cartman has saved his life. In Imaginationland, Butters, the Lollipop King, and Snarf arrive at the Castle . The guards suspect Butters is connected with the terrorist attack and bring him shirtless and in chains before the Council of Nine, consisting of the nine most revered of all imaginary characters: Aslan, Gandalf, Glinda, Jesus, Luke Skywalker, Morpheus, Popeye, Wonder Woman, and Zeus. The council meets with Butters, and determine that he is \"The Key\", a legendary hero who will save them all. Butters does not like this, but the Council tells him that he has no choice but to help them if he ever wants to go home again. The good characters of Imaginationland prepare for battle with the evil characters, even though most of them are totally unsuited for battle. Back in the Pentagon, the general, seeing that their imaginations have run wild, orders for a nuke to be launched through the portal. At this point, a weakened Kyle awakens in the hospital with Cartman at his side, waving his contract smugly. His plans for ball-sucking are still going forward as the episode ends.',\n",

However, during a test run, a team composed of Dr. Jonathan Kirk, Carly Meyers and Dr. Jack Hoffman send a blast of energy into the ionosphere, driving the planet into unexpected natural disasters. The experiment also causes a damage of the weather control laboratory which causes the police led by the detective Devon Williams to begin the investigation. Dr. Jonathan Kirk  is the only one to intervene and demand that the system be destroyed, but Terrell denies his requests, pushing his team forward. As a result, Dr. Kirk contacts news reporter Danni Wilson  to help him expose the secrecy and lies — which turns out to be Terrell working with Army General Braxton  to use the technology as a key military weapon instead of for philanthropic reasons, as initially claimed — of Terrell and the events that are unfolding. General Braxton, however, has ordered hit men to murder Dr. Kirk as he works his way to shutdown the technology and save humanity. The hit men murder Danni first and make it look like she was killed by Dr. Kirk so he is immediately considered a prime suspect and arrested. However, Det. Williams begins to doubt that he is the murderer. To show the importance of the discovery to General Braxton, Terrell orders the team to create a huge storm in Afghanistan which disables the Afghan rebels. But another blast of energy to the ionosphere only makes the situation worse and a strong hurricane appears over the Pacific, heading to Peru. The team then manages to redirect the hurricane away from the coast but then several hurricanes start to endanger the U.S. mainland, the largest being headed to Los Angeles. After escaping the hit men again Dr. Kirk is captured by Stillman from the military intelligence who knows many things about the weather experiment. He shows Dr. Kirk the hole in the ionosphere which is the cause of the extreme weather around the world and offers him a help to develop a method to reverse the damage of the ionosphere. After Dr. Kirk succeeds Stillman admits he was a bait set by Terrell to get Dr. Kirk back and tries to shoot him but he defeats Stillman and calls Det. Williams to join him during the visit of the lab. The hit men appear again and begin shooting at them but are killed by Det. Williams in the shootout. As the Pentagon cancels the funding of the research for causing uncontrollable weather changes General Braxton pushes Terrell to stop the violent weather by all means necessary but the research team has no idea how to settle the things without making it worse. Facing the imminent catastrophe, Terrell stops pushing the team, allowing them to do whatever they want. Dr. Kirk arrives in time to apply his method to fix the hole in the ionosphere. The action is successful but Terrell who sees the solution for the problem changes his mind and aims a gun at the team. He is then shot by Det.

The basis for this short film, narrated by Jack Webb, is the alleged Soviet re-creation of US communities for the purpose of training infiltrators, spies, and moles. The film begins in what looks like a typical American town. The camera moves back to reveal barbed wire, barricades, and soldiers in Soviet Army uniforms. Narrator Jack Webb informs us that there are several places behind the Iron Curtain used for training Soviet espionage and sabotage forces prior to infiltrating America. Webb introduces us to a typical American family of father Jerry ([[Jack Kelly , wife Helen , and daughter Linda  Donovan. Her boyfriend Bill Martin ([[Peter Brown  has been invited to dinner but while Jerry lectures Bill on football plays, Bill only has eyes for Linda. All is not well, as Jerry's missing his PTA meeting to go bowling, and his intention to miss his Army Reserve training does not go over well with Helen. Linda and Bill inform Jerry and Helen they wish to get married but Jerry is angered and says they are too young, but he would have no objection if they waited five years after university. Jack Webb explains how safe Jerry is in his world, but when Jerry goes to sleep, Webb looks grim and tells the audience Jerry is going to have a Red Nightmare. Jerry awakes to find meetings in the public square about infiltrating America to bring down Capitalism. He returns home to find his daughter going to a farm collective escorted by Bill, who is now in Russian Army uniform. Helen informs Jerry that he will have to address the PTA on the glories of communism, which Jerry refuses to do, but his wife says he has no choice. At work, Jerry's foreman  tells him that he has not met his quota and must work through the lunch break to meet it. On Sunday morning, Jerry wakes to find his two youngest children being sent to a State Communist school against his wishes. Jerry insists on the children going to Sunday School, and takes them to their church that has been turned into a museum glorifying the Soviet Union, including many inventions made by Americans which the Soviets claim to have invented. Jerry knocks the exhibits over, and is arrested by troops led by a Commissar . Jerry is brought to trial at a Soviet tribunal , where there is no jury nor a defense attorney. Jerry demands to know what he is charged with, but the rights Americans take for granted are long gone. After condemning testimony from several witnesses, including his own wife, Jerry is convicted and sentenced to death. When he is strapped into the execution chair, Jerry gives a speech about the Soviet people waking up one day to overthrow communism, before he gets a bullet in the head from the Commissar. Jerry wakes up to his freedoms and apologizes to Bill and Linda.

Horrified by their religious practices, the Spaniards set out to convert the native population to Catholicism, effectively declaring war upon the Aztec religion. According to an ancient prophecy, the Aztecs and their religion will return to dominance in a time known as the Sixth Sun. While attempting to illegally cross the United States-Mexico border, young orphan boy Juan Diego is singled out by a fellow traveler, a strange old man known only as \"Old Indian\" claiming to know the way. The old man leads the boy to an old Aztec shrine dedicated to the god of death, Mictlantecuhtli.

He shares an apartment with his best friend Zak and is in love with Maria, niece of Padre Somera of the local mission which dates back to the Cortés era.

Diego awakens in the Aztec afterlife of Mictlan where the god of death sacrifices him to Tezcatlipoca in a ritual where his heart is torn from his chest with the aid of an obsidian blade. He is then sent back to the land of the living exactly one year after his death. Diego, selected long ago by the Old Indian, is the sacrificial priest in service to Tezcatlipoca. In order to fulfill the prophecy of the Sixth Sun, Tezcatlipoca requires three human sacrifices, each symbolizing the Catholic Church that wiped out the old gods over five hundred years ago. And Maria, being the direct descendant of the Somera family is at risk. Armed with the power to take life or restore it, Diego must struggle against the very gods who created him in order to save the woman he loves.',\n",

Tom is 33 years old, a Harvard graduate. He barely survived as an Army paratroop officer during World War II, having fought in both the European and Pacific combat theaters . Tom has haunting flashbacks of the affair as well as his combat experiences—these would almost certainly be diagnosed as PTSD today. He killed 17 men in combat. His selfish and materialistic stay-at-home wife knows only that Tom is somehow \"changed\" since the war. She feels his job with a Manhattan charitable organization pays too little, so she and a fellow train commuter urge him to interview for a job at a New York-based television network. Tom lands a public relations job, working for Ralph Hopkins, the top man at the network, an empire-builder surrounded by politicking yes-men. Hopkins is to propose the establishment of national mental health services to a group of physicians and offer his own prestige and network toward that end. Tom must solve how his boss can best present the proposal so that the learned doctors will rise in unison and appoint Hopkins to spearhead the campaign. Hired on a six-month probationary basis, Tom reports to a humorless game-player who rejects five different drafts of the speech and ends up substituting one of his own. Hopkins is satisfied, but Tom persuades him that the approach is all wrong, that it misrepresents Hopkins\\' qualifications to head the campaign. Tom\\'s approach is more sensible; Hopkins is impressed. Tom reminds Hopkins of his own son, who was killed in combat. There are a number of subplots:  The caretaker of Tom\\'s late grandmother tries to fraudulently inherit her home;  Hopkins\\' estrangement from his wife and daughter ; and  Tom\\'s adulterous behavior during the war and an out-of-wedlock son conceived in Italy, whose mother suddenly contacts him to seek monetary support at a most inconvenient time. With no understanding of the horrors of war, Betsy goes berserk on hearing of this secret, but eventually calms down and understands mutual emotional support—not just mutual ambition—binding wife and husband. In the end, seeing the example of how his boss\\'s marriage and family life have been ruined by overwork, Tom turns down a high-pressure position in order to work normal hours and spend more time at home.',\n",

       "  \"When the Cole's Santa Claus gets drunk before taking part in the Thanksgiving parade, Dorey Walker , Cole's director of special events, fires him and must find a replacement immediately. She spots an old man  berating the inebriated Santa, and begs him to take over. He claims his name is Kris Kringle. Kris does so well during the parade that he is immediately hired to be Cole's main Santa for the holiday period. All the children in New York begin to believe that he is the real Santa, with the exception of Dorey's six-year-old daughter Susan . Dorey's boyfriend, Bryan Bedford , does his best to convince Susan to believe. While being babysat one night by Kris, Susan shares with him her Christmas wish, she would like a dad, a house  and a baby brother. Kris asks if she would begin to believe in Santa if she got all those things. Susan agrees that she would. Kris is credited with bringing in many more sales to Cole's than previous years, until one night, when he is arrested, then sanctioned for supposedly assaulting a man on the street. Later, the truth emerges, that the man he assaulted was the original drunk Santa, who set up Kris to be arrested, with the help of members of staff from a rival of Cole's. With the help of Bryan, Dorey takes Kris' case to court, and drums up support for him from the public. It soon becomes clear that to get Kris acquitted and freed, Bryan must prove that not only does Santa exist, but that Kris is the real one. It is a seemingly impossible task until Bryan comes up with a plan that requires some help from Susan. Just as the judge is about to make his decision -- and it seems he was going to rule against Kris -- Susan walks up to the judge with a Christmas card containing a $1 bill. On the back, the words In God We Trust are circled. The judge realizes that, since the U.S. Department of Treasury can believe in God with no hard evidence, then the people of New York can believe in Santa Claus in the same way. This leaves the elated judge no other choice but to declare that Santa is real, thus freeing Kris. Following the court case, Dorey and Bryan are maneuvered by Kris into realizing their true feelings for each other, and are married in a very small ceremony right after the Christmas Eve Midnight Mass. On Christmas morning, Susan wakes to the news of the marriage and is elated to see that she has part one of her Christmas wish, a dad. Together, Susan, Dorey and Bryan drive out to the catalogue house and upon arrival, find that Kris has arranged for them to purchase the house. Susan, now having got two out of three of her wishes, excitedly runs upstairs in the house to look at her bedroom. Dorey and Bryan ask her what the last part of her Christmas wish was, and she triumphantly announces that it was a baby brother. Dorey and Bryan both look at each other, shocked, before glancing down at Dorey's stomach and sharing a kiss. The film ends with the belief that Susan has now gotten all she asked for.\",\n",

When he learns that the evil Zor and his army are approaching his castle, he asks his daughter Mila to bring his former student Ator back to help defeat Zor. Mila runs away to find Ator.

Mila says that she knows Ator must fight evil where ever it occurs. Ator leaves Thong behind to help take care of Mila and Akronas, and leaves.

Veronica, already predisposed to dislike her new daughter-in-law  is further disappointed to find that she is a brash American who, like the Major, speaks fluent French. Larita also meets John's former girlfriend and neighbour Sarah Hurst , who is gracious about the marriage. Larita remains calm in the face of her new mother-in-law's disdain, even being so bold as to reveal having been previously married.

Time passes, and to Larita's disappointment, John is not eager to leave the estate so that they can find a home of their own. Larita is bored and miserable in the countryside and hates blood sports like hunting, and indeed any of the entertainment country English people seem to enjoy. She reads Lady Chatterley's Lover, by D.H. Lawrence, which shocks her husband's female relatives, and she doesn't want to play tennis.

The Dodos think exactly the same, even saying he should have a bird as a best friend instead of Mr. Snuffleupagus. This causes Big Bird much distress. When Big Bird runs away from his new home and ends up on the news, Miss Finch tells Kermit the Frog that she will reclaim him. Big Bird\\'s friends on Sesame Street also see the news and band together to find him. In a Volkswagen Beetle is the group of Gordon, Olivia, Linda, and Cookie Monster.

The children do so and the next day, his friends sneak into the circus tent to try to free him. However, the Sleaze Brothers quietly wake up and attempt to drive off with Big Bird in tow.

       "  'Interviewing leaders of animal organizations and volunteers who went to New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, it is revealed that at the beginning, everyone had different ideas about how things should be done, but no one was willing to take charge because the problem was bigger than anyone could have imagined. The film champions the volunteers whose only concern was saving animals, unlike the animal organizations who were more concerned with the chain of command. After about a month, the state put the Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in charge who told the volunteers to stop rescuing. Anyone not with the LA/SPCA was considered ‘rogue’ and operating outside the authority. Meanwhile, the police in St. Bernard Parish were shooting dogs in what they say was a form of mercy. Months after Katrina, many owners are still not reunited with their pets because they do not know where they are and do not have the means to find them. Some people have found that their animals have been adopted out and cannot get them back. The film ends with Barkus, a Louisiana pet parade, indicating New Orleans was not washed away with the hurricane.',\n",

       "  \"Chun Jae-in, an orphan-turned-police detective, is assigned a job to go undercover in a high school to befriend Seung-hee, the daughter of notorious gangster Cha Young-jae, and protect her from any of her father's enemies who may want to use her as bait to get Cha Young-jae to do what they want, as well as get information about her father's work from her. At first, Jae-in is very reluctant to accept the job; however, her uncle, also a detective, pushes her at the last minute to take it. Jae-in is considered a loser when she first steps into her class, and the gang girls confront her afterward and challenge her to a fight at the backyard of the school. Jae-in, being a policewoman, easily beats them up. This earns her some sort of respect, although what Jae-in really wants is Seung-hee's friendship. She eventually gets this with the help of Kang No-young, a handsome classmate and next-door neighbor who she starts to like; however, Jae-in thinks her crush is wrong because of their age difference. Meanwhile, a new teacher arrives at their school. Jae-in later is informed that he is also an undercover agent, working on her side. She becomes slightly suspicious of him and vaguely recognizes his face. One day after school, Jae-in and other policemen spot Cha Young-jae outside an airport; they rush to catch him, but his rivals are also on the chase. They meet up in the parking lot, where Cha Young-jae is trapped. Suddenly a mysterious motorcycle rider speeds into the middle of the group and his motorcycle produces white smoke, therefore allowing Cha Young-jae to get away. Jae-in and other police go after the motorcycle driver, since Cha Young-jae has already gotten away. The undercover teacher also happens to be at the event and shoots at the motorcycle driver, but the driver gets away. Jae-in rushes after him, but the undercover teacher puts a gun to her head. She assumes it is not serious and runs after the driver, but all she finds is a watch strangely identical to that of No-young's. When she gets home, she knocks at No-young's door and confronts him about his watch. No-young shrugs it off and is playful; however, once he gets inside his apartment, he takes off his shirt, revealing a bullet wound to the camera. Jae-in does not know of this, but she suspects that No-young is also undercover as a spy. Jae-in increasingly becomes more suspicious of No-young, although she is still head-over-heels about him. One day she challenges him to a Judo match during a physical education class at school. During the match, they vocally argue, although none of their classmates or the teacher seems to notice; by the end of the match, they both know of each other's real position as undercover agents. Jae-in thereafter confesses to Seung-hee that she is not really a schoolgirl, which in turn gets Seung-hee very upset. Jae-in then receives news: her beloved uncle has been stabbed by an unknown person. She sobs, overcome with grief at the loss of her only family. The camera then shows her with Seung-hee in a car with a fellow policeman. The policeman betrays Jae-in and Seung-hee and leads them to the site where Cha Young-jae has been captured and is meeting with a rival gang leader. No-young arrives, and Jae-in teams up with him to fight off everyone. Jae-in goes to capture the rival gang leader; however, as she is handcuffing him, a gun is put to her head. She turns to see the undercover teacher, who was supposed to be on her side. He reveals to her that he was the one who stabbed her uncle, and she becomes overcome with rage. Meanwhile, No-young is wounded and running out of energy; as an undercover spy, he cannot reveal himself, for he would get caught. He slips away quietly as Jae-in punches the undercover teacher again and again. A police officer finally handcuffs the undercover teacher and leads him away. Cha Young-jae is sent off to an emergency room in an ambulance with Seung-hee, and Jae-in receives news that her uncle will get better. The movie then cuts to a scene where Jae-in is undercover once again. It has been some time since the Cha Young-jae case, although the movie does not specifically say how long. This time, Jae-in is undercover as a singing nun. She bolts after a criminal down alleys and streets; finally, when she catches up with the criminal, she realizes he has already been knocked out by someone. She looks around and discovers No-young. She starts to punch him, but he blocks it. They reconcile and kiss.\",\n",
       "  'In September 1942, Captain Yamagami  is ordered to rendezvous the Yamato with the Combined Fleet that is gathering at the Truk Islands  in Micronesia, a key strategic point in the South Pacific. With beautiful clear blue skies above and surrounded by coral reefs below, this South Seas paradise became a strong base for the Combined Fleet and the front lines of the naval war; a place where many fierce battles were fought. Decades later, the sea bed surrounding the Truk Islands is still littered with the remains of more than 60 warships and airplanes. Among Yamagami’s crew are the cantankerous Divisional Officer Noboru Osako  and the young Ensign Takeshi Kaido . Unsure of what the future may bring, Kaido went off to war without declaring his intentions for his childhood sweetheart, Chie Kojima . He always carries her photo in his coat pocket, while Chie longs for his return to their seaside hometown. When the Yamato arrives at Truk, the married Osako decides to ease his worries over leaving behind a pregnant wife by sneaking an island woman named Momoka  aboard ship for some private recreation. But to Osako’s annoyance, Momoka brings along her elderly grandfather  who insists on telling him a local tale about monsters that has been passed down for generations. The disbelieving naval officer is told that the surrounding waters are home to man-sized, carnivorous Bonefishes…and, as dangerous as the fish are, they are nothing more than an “opening act” for an even greater menace; the legendary Hell King of the Seas called Reigo. The next night, a lookout spots a massive shape half-submerged in the distance. Believing it to be an enemy submarine, the Yamato fires on it and scores a direct hit. Osako is shocked when the object emits a strange cry as it sinks beneath the waves. He reports the incident and the story of Reigo to his commander and shipmates. Unbeknownst to the crew, they have killed the offspring of Reigo. Not long after that first encounter, a school of luminous Bonefish launch themselves from the water like flying fish and attack a group of soldiers standing watch on the Yamato’s deck. Kaido hears their screams and rushes to the rescue, but finds the men already torn to pieces. Just as the old man predicted, the Bonefish herald the arrival of Reigo, a beast 80 meters-long and resembling a cross between Godzilla and a shark. Seething with rage at the murder of its cub, the monster attacks the Combined Fleet with incredible ferocity and awesome destructive power. The naval forces are caught off guard, and Reigo is able to destroy escort ships and damage the Yamato before returning to the ocean depths. The crew quickly regroups and plans a counterattack, but when Reigo returns it manages to stay one step ahead of the Japanese forces. Almost as if it is aware that the Yamato’s main guns are long range weapons which are ineffective up close, the monster attacks at close range or blasts the ships from underwater with blue bursts of electricity. Thoughts of family and lovers back home… fear at being confronted by an unknown enemy…conflict and confrontation explode among the officers and crew over the best battle strategy to use against the threat of Reigo. Over Osako’s loud objections, Kaido suggests a last-ditch plan of attack that will either stop Reigo or sink the Yamato. Now the stage is set for a final battle to unfold between the world’s largest battleship and the mysterious dragon-like monster that glides through the seas at will. Which one will prevail… Reigo or the battleship Yamato?',\n",

Fighting many obstacles, Cabot is the only player left in the game and is about to be killed by crazed villagers when he is saved by a Parmistan warrior who turns out to be Cabot\\'s father. His father explains that while playing the game he fell and disabled his arm, but was allowed by Parmistan warriors to live. As the two are catching up, Zamir fires an arrow into Cabot\\'s father, who in a hushed voice tells Cabot to go on and win the race. Cabot races off, chased by Zamir\\'s army. He is able to make his horse jump a gorge and gets away while only Zamir is brave enough to follow. Seeing that Zamir won\\'t let him escape, Cabot decides to take him on and after a prolonged fight Cabot\\'s gymkata skills allow him to defeat Zamir. Meanwhile, Princess Rubali finally convinces the King that Zamir is plotting to overthrow the monarchy. Using their combined fighting skills, the Princess and the King attack Zamir\\'s men before encouraging the citizens of Parmistan to rise up and seize the rest. As the crowd takes down Zamir\\'s army someone cries out that a contestant is approaching the finish line. As everyone runs to see who made it, Princess Rubali is thrilled to see that Cabot is riding in on a horse, leading his arrow-punctured but still alive father on another horse.

       "  ' Sitting alone at a roadside bar in Arizona, Fred \"Rabbit\" Smith  drinks nervously. Two people named Jack La Roca  and Stephanie  enter the bar. Rabbit uses the restroom followed by Jack who handcuffs him. He reveals that he and Steph are Federal Marshals assigned to capture Rabbit and bring him to court in Los Angeles to testify against a mob boss named Benny who Rabbit used to work for. He was originally going to testify in exchange for full immunity but ran after learning the mob joined forces with the Russians. They are hunting him, too. Jack calls for a Suburban driven by four other marshals to pick them up before Benny and his mob arrive with heavy firepower. They leave out the back and battle the assassins until marshals; Nick, Marry, PT and Joe arrive between them. They manage to kill all assassins but Benny. Jack and Rabbit use Rabbit\\'s car to escape in the same path as the other marshals . Jack manages to shoot Benny\\'s tires out before leaving. PT complains to Steph about Jack, believing he isn\\'t trustworthy. She tells him to focus on finding out where they are. Jack tries to find the roads they are using on the map but Rabbit tells him that the back roads are too old and don\\'t have a place on the map except for his old guide. He reads him that a second highway exists next to Route 66 which leads faster to the California border. The road is Route 666 that was condemned after a prison road crew accident. Hearing the story, Jack has strange quick flashbacks of four prisoners digging a hole surrounded by law-enforcement. Meanwhile, Benny shoots a tourist and takes his Jeep. The marshals arrive at a deserted tourist attraction bordering Route 666 and see a restricted access sign. As Jack debates about using the road, he experiences more flashbacks and tells Steph that he was born around the area and his mother died when he was six and he hardly knew his father. Much to Rabbit\\'s dismay, Jack kicks open the gates and the group drive onto it, Steph rides with Jack and Rabbit. Unknown to them, a county sheriff\\'s deputy named Gill has been following them. He sees they went down Route 666 and requests for backup on the radio. His father, Sheriff Conaway, denies and tells him to leave the road. Gill ignores and pulls the two vehicles over. Jack and PT confront him and Gill abusively tells them the road is restricted. Jack shows him his badge and he leaves irritated. They drive along until they spot a cemetery along the road and stop there. Jack and Steph explore the graveyard, finding Jack\\'s father, John La Roca\\'s grave. PT sees the grave along with three others next to it are the graves of Miles Hackman, Frank Slater and Steven Pikowski. PT explains that all but John La Roca were infamous murderers from the 1960s. La Roca was a bank robber who quit robbing after marrying a woman in a small town and having a baby, Jack. After six years there was no more money for his family so he tried to rob a bank but was caught and thrown in the same prison as Hackman, Slater and Pikowski. PT suddenly realizes La Roca is Jack\\'s father. They soon start to fight each other. Mary and Nick leave Joe to watch Rabbit while they go back into the Suburban and have sex. Behind Joe, Benny appears and fires at the two with a silenced gun. Before he can reach Rabbit Joe stabs Benny and takes his gun. Blood rushes out of Benny\\'s back which suddenly attracts the decomposed walking corpses of Slater, La Roca, Pikowski and Hackman. They capture Joe and drag him to the road where they pound his back into the asphalt with a jackhammer. Rabbit hopelessly takes the silencer off the gun and fires at the zombies, alerting everyone else. The team battles the undead with no effect and they escape the area. Jack stays behind to slow the zombies and uses the stolen Jeep to escape but crashes. Jack wakes up in a cave next to a native, explaining that he found him and brought him here. He tells him that he us restore peace to the cursed road because haunted spirits still walk it. A confused Jack thanks the man and leaves. Nick leaves to smoke in the Suburban. He slowly falls asleep until Slater slams his fingers off with the car door and slams his head with a sledge hammer. He travels along the road until he sees the two vehicles with their tires melted at a ruined drive-in theatre and is reunited with the rest of the group. The group goes to check in on Nick while Rabbit stays handcuffed to a pole and stomps a Scorpion, exposing much blood. Rabbit turns around to see Pikowski\\'s zombie swinging a pick axe at him and missing. Rabbit manages to pull the pole out and escape with Pikowski not following. He catches up with the group and sees that Nick is missing. Rabbit thinks and establishes that the zombies can only travel on the road and concrete/cement and they appear from underground. Jack spots an old telephone booth and successfully dials 911, connecting with Sheriff Conaway. Jack gives him the number of the Los Angeles Marshal’s office and tells him to call the office and request backup. He agrees and hangs up. After four hours of waiting, Jack has another flashback and sees his father, Slater, Hackman and Pikowski working on a road when Hackman pulls out a knife and attempts to escape while John hides under a machine and tries to stay away from the trouble. The escape fails and the unseen police office in charge makes them start digging a large hole. Hearing sirens, they spot Sheriff Conaway along with his deputies, Tim and Gill. Jack and Rabbit go to the bathroom stall while Conaway and his officers hold everyone else at gunpoint. Conaway demands to know where Jack is; only hearing that Jack is dead. Conaway shoots Mary in order to make PT tell them that Jack and Rabbit are in the stall. Tim and Gil grab Rabbit who is wearing Jack\\'s badge to confuse them and brings him outside. Jack draws Gil out and points a gun at his head when he enters his truck. They drive further away and Jack handcuffs Gil to the truck and breaks his nose. He begs for him to not stay on the road, stating the zombies kill anything on the road. Jack asks why when the four zombies rise again and start approaching. Gil uncuffs himself but is too late as they knock him down and kill him with the jackhammer. Jack drives back and Conaway goes to the truck thinking Gil is in it and PT fights Tim who drops his shotgun but is able to shoot PT in the stomach with his pistol. Rabbit picks up the shotgun and shoots Tim. Jack punches Conaway multiple times and restrains him to the SUV. Conaway starts bleeding and asks where his son is. Jack doesn\\'t reply and Conaway slowly realizes that the zombies put him in the road. He explains that they travel under the road and feed on blood to stay strong or they are unable to rise from underground and that blood awakens them. Jack wonders how Conaway knows so much about the zombies and has a final flashback. It is night and we see that the unseen boss is Sheriff Conaway whom the prison warden put in charge of the gang. Though La Roca didn\\'t assist in the attempted escape, he is knocked unconscious and thrown into the hole dug by the three others. Conaway and his men open fire at the convicts in their legs, keeping them alive and preventing them to move out of the hole. Conaway plans to tell the warden that there was an accident and the convicts were caught under the roller. He starts the steam roller and buries the four men alive. Conaway and his thugs learn about the zombies return and they were killing anyone whoever set foot on the road to cover up the crime and the zombies. Jack finally realizes this and continuously yells and brutally punches at Conaway. Conaway begs him not to be in the road. Suddenly, the zombies arrive. They pin Jack down and Conaway tries to enter the SUV but Rabbit knocks him out. He and Steph are unable to kill the zombies by gunfire as the jackhammer is brought up. Jack looks at John and yells with sympathy that he is his son. After seconds, John suddenly snaps and pushes the jackhammer into Slater\\'s stomach, destroying his spirit and body. He then kills Hackman with the jackhammer which stops working. Pikowski hits John multiple times with the hammer until he looses too much blood energy. Jack cuts his hand with a knife and embraces it into his father\\'s hand. With enough energy, John thanks his son and chokes Pikowski, killing him. John tears off his dog tag and gives it to Jack. John is then able to walk onto the dirt and crosses the afterlife into Heaven, finally lifting the curse on Route 666. Conaway emerges from the SUV and he was going to shoot them until Jack, Steph and Rabbit shoot him everywhere. He falls barely stable to the ground and has an unseen vision of an even larger steam roller  coming towards him. He shoots at it with no effect and it crushes him. Jack, Steph and Rabbit walk alone along Route 666 to head to the Arizona/California border as Jack finally pieces together what the native said to him. With Sheriff Conaway and his thugs dead Route 666 is now peaceful once more. Jack, Steph and Rabbit walk along the sunset and they know that the curse has been finally lifted.',\n",

After dragging the answer out of youngest son Jason  and a whole night to think it over, Geneva secretly  agrees to let Andrea race in Andrew\\'s place. The catch, however, is that this all needs to happen behind Edward\\'s back, and before he comes home with a replacement rider. Andrea and her mother arrive at the race venue and register under her brother\\'s name, \"Andy\". In spite of her initial confidence, Andrea learns the hard way that competition is fierce, and finishes last in her first race. Thinking that Andrea is a guy, competitor Dean Talon  takes notice when the \"lapper\" garners the attention of several young women, finding it unbelievable that a 125 rider is getting looks. Dean, knowing that \"Andrew\" needs help with riding, offers to help the rookie in exchange for advice on his crush, Faryn Henderson . Andrea quickly finds herself falling for Dean, who she reluctantly helps win Faryn\\'s shallow affection. Her training also pays off when she places 7th in a following race. Still on the up-and-up, she takes 3rd place in the following race, only to be caught by her angry father immediately after when he arrives unexpectedly and orders Geneva and Andrea back home. Edward has now found a replacement rider from France, René Cartier . His arrogance immediately fouls up the room, and things are no better when he is offered a stay at the Carson home. He is especially poorly-received by Andrea after he tries to hit on her, and treats her brothers with disrespect. After some research, Andrea learns that Cartier has garnered a bad reputation for his harsh, underhanded, and dangerous behavior on the track, but when Andrew brings it to Edward\\'s attention, he says that an aggressive rider is what the family needs at the moment. Andrea finds no further solace when she finds Cartier talking with Art Henderson, a competitor, though she is only given a scolding by Edward when he sees the two of them arguing over it. Back at camp after talking with Geneva, Edward begins to realize how much racing really means to Andrea and the support the rest of the family has given her. He finds Andrea arguing with Cartier and Andrea says that she\\'s only trying to help her family and Cartier rudely tells her to back off before shoving her. Edward sees it and runs over to them, firing Cartier. He and Andrea then go for a walk where Edward tells her that is proud of her for bringing Carson Racing to where it is now and allows her to do the final race. On the final race, Andrea and Cartier, now racing under Art Henderson Racing, find themselves fighting fiercely for the finish. When Cartier fumbles on a turn, Andrea takes the victory and finishes 1st in the final lap. However, an angry Cartier exposes her during a live interview, much to the shock of the entire community and Dean\\'s dismay. A heated argument between the Carson family and Art Henderson Racing gets under way about disqualifying Andrea by saying that a girl isn\\'t allowed to compete, which Geneva argues saying that she read the rulebook and it doesn\\'t mention anywhere about girls not being allowed to race. Henderson then tries to argue that Andrea wasn\\'t registered and Geneva pulls out the registration form showing that Andrea did register under \"Andy Carson\", as it\\'s short for Andrea . Barbara Rollins , the corporate CEO, expresses her inspiration at Andrea\\'s actions. She is inspired that a woman \"came on top in a man\\'s sport,\" and not only allows Andrea to retain her title, but also awards the entire Carson family a full factory sponsorship. Back at home, Geneva surprises the kids with the news that they have the privilege of hiring a 250 rider for the next race. Already having someone in mind, she tells Andrea to interview the new rider. Upon walking outside, Andrea finds Dean and learns that he had signed onto their team, and challenges him to a race.',\n",

Joe then jumps into the river and enters the semi-flooded bus, but this seems to cause the bus to shift and it moves further downriver, flooding as it goes until it\\'s completely submerged. Joe is trapped inside when one of his legs gets jammed under the seat. At first he fights to escape, but calms down when a bright glow fills the bus and his wife appears to him. She reaches her hand out and they connect. The events of her final hours flash before him. He sees that she survived the initial accident and was pulled to safety by nearby Yanomami villagers. He is then suddenly rescued out of the bus by Victor. Determined to reach the village, Joe runs to it, alarming Victor who says they need permission first. Reaching it, he\\'s surrounded by angry native men holding weapons. He holds up a photo of his wife. A native woman walks up to him and begins speaking to him, saying that they couldn\\'t save her body but they saved her soul. Perplexed, he follows her into one of the huts, and inside is a female infant in a basket. The child his wife was carrying had survived the accident. Immediately tears begin to flow from his eyes. The woman shows him a birthmark on the child; it is in the shape of a dragonfly on the inside of her ankle. As he embraces his daughter, he drops to his knees and begins to sob, realizing what his wife was trying to tell him.

This provokes her to begin a relationship with Olivier, and to resurrect her late husband's last composition, which has been changing according to her notes on Olivier's work. Olivier decides not to incorporate the changes suggested by Julie, stating that this piece is now his music and has ceased to be Patrice's. He says that she must either accept his composition with all its roughness or she must allow people to know the truth about her composition. She agrees on the grounds that the truth about her husband's music would not be revealed as her own work. In the final sequence, the Unity of Europe piece is played (which features chorus and a solo soprano singing [[Saint Paul , and images are seen of all the people Julie has affected by her actions.

       "  'Rachel Phelps, a former Las Vegas showgirl, has inherited the Cleveland Indians baseball team from her deceased husband. She wants to move the team to the warmer climate of Miami. In order to do this, she must reduce the season\\'s attendance at Cleveland Stadium to under 800,000 tickets sold, which will trigger an escape clause in the team\\'s lease with the city of Cleveland. After she moves the team, she would also be able to release all the current players and replace them with new ones. She instructs her new General Manager Charlie Donovan to hire the worst team possible from a list she has already prepared. The list includes veteran catcher Jake Taylor, who has problems with his knees, and was last playing in Mexico; incarcerated pitcher Ricky Vaughn; power-hitting outfielder Pedro Cerrano, who practices voodoo to try to help him hit curve balls; veteran pitcher Eddie Harris, who no longer has a strong throwing arm and is forced to doctor his pitches; and third baseman Roger Dorn, a one-time star who is under contract but has become a high-priced prima donna. As manager Phelps hires Lou Brown, a career minor league manager of the Toledo Mud Hens who works in the offseason as a tire salesman. At spring training in Tucson, Arizona, the brash but speedy center fielder Willie \"Mays\" Hayes crashes camp uninvited, but is invited to join the team after displaying his running speed. Spring training reveals several problems with the new players. Vaughn has an incredible fastball but lacks control. Hayes is able to run the bases quickly but hits only pop flies, and Cerrano, despite his tremendous power, cannot hit a curveball. The veterans have their own problems: Dorn refuses to aggressively field ground balls, afraid that potential injuries will damage his upcoming contract negotiations, and it becomes clear that Taylor\\'s bad knees will be a season-long concern. On the final day, when Brown is to cut the team down to 25 players, Dorn plays a practical joke on Vaughn, making him believe he was cut, resulting in a locker-room brawl. After the team returns to Cleveland for their opening game, Taylor takes Vaughn and Hayes out to dinner but comes across his ex-girlfriend Lynn, who is dining with her current beau. Taylor believes he can try to win her back by proclaiming that he has a major league job again, but is disappointed to hear that she is already engaged. The Indians\\' season starts off poorly with Vaughn\\'s initial pitching appearances ending in disaster, his wild pitches earning him the derogatory title \"Wild Thing.\" On a rare occasion when Vaughn does throw one for a strike, it is hit well over 400 feet by the New York Yankees\\' best hitter, Clu Haywood. Brown discovers that Vaughn\\'s eyesight is poor, and after Vaughn is given glasses he becomes very accurate. \"Wild Thing\" remains Vaughn\\'s nickname, and he becomes the team\\'s ace. The team begins winning and is able to bring their win-loss percentage to .400. Phelps realizes this is not bad enough to stall attendance and decides to demoralize the team further by removing luxuries, such as replacing their team jet airplane with a dilapidated prop-plane, later replacing that with a bus. However, these changes do not affect the Indians\\' performance and the team continues to improve. Donovan reveals Phelps\\' plan to Brown who then relays the same news to the players, telling them that if the team plays too well for Phelps to void the lease, she will bring in worse players in the offseason who will. Taylor says that, since they have nothing to lose, the team should get back at Phelps by winning the pennant. Brown gives the team an incentive by removing one portion of a dress on a cardboard cut-out photo of Phelps taken during her showgirl days for every win the team achieves. The team plays very well down the stretch of the season, and eventually clinch a tie for the division by beating the Chicago White Sox on the last day of the season. This forces a one-game playoff with the division\\'s co-leaders, the Yankees. Prior to the playoff, Taylor continues to try to woo Lynn back and they share a night together. Vaughn learns that he will not be the starting pitcher for the game and goes to a bar to mope, where he encounters Suzanne Dorn. On the television broadcast of the Indians\\' victory party, Suzanne had seen her husband leave the team\\'s hotel lobby with another woman; she retaliates by luring Vaughn to sleep with her. Vaughn is unaware of who she is until she tells him when she leaves Vaughn and Taylor\\'s shared apartment. Taylor advises Vaughn to keep his distance from Dorn for most of the game by staying in the bullpen. The game remains scoreless until the seventh inning when Harris gives up two runs. Cerrano comes to the plate in the bottom of the seventh and misses badly on two curveballs. He angrily threatens his voodoo god Jo-bu and proclaims \"If you not help me now. I say Fuck you Jo-Bu, I do it myself,\" then hits a two-run home run off a curveball on the next pitch to tie the game.  In the top of the ninth, the Yankees are able to load the bases for the power-hitting Clu Haywood, and Vaughn is called in to relieve Harris with the crowd going crazy. Vaughn and Taylor are concerned when Dorn comes over to the pitcher\\'s mound, but he only urges Vaughn to strike the next batter out. While Taylor taunts Haywood from behind home plate, Vaughn strikes out his nemesis on three straight fastballs to end the inning. With two outs in the bottom of the ninth, Hayes manages to single to first and subsequently steals second. Taylor is next to bat, and after signaling back and forth with Brown, points to the bleachers, calling his shot. However, Taylor bunts instead, catching the Yankees infield off-guard. Despite his weak knees, Taylor gets to first base. Instead of stopping, Hayes rounds third and heads for home plate, catching the Yankees off-guard again. Hayes slides safely into home, giving the Indians the win on a walk-off single. As the team celebrates, Dorn punches Vaughn in the face but then helps him up to continue the celebration. Jake finds Lynn in the stands, who raises her left hand to show that she is no longer wearing an engagement ring.',\n",

After Bob meets romance novelist Mary Fisher  at a dinner party, they begin having an affair; Mary also hires him as her accountant. Though aware of the affair, Ruth initially lives in denial  and continues to take care of her two children, Nicolette  and Andrew , and doing other household chores. However, Ruth soon begins to feel ragged after trying to prepare for Bob\\'s parents\\' visit, culminating with Ruth finding Andrew\\'s dead gerbil in a casserole pot. After Ruth confronts him about his affair in front of his parents, Bob decides to pack up his things and leave Ruth with the kids, calling her a liability and telling her she is a bad mother, a lousy wife, a terrible cook, and has the appearance of a \"she-devil.\" Now at her breaking point, Ruth vows to get revenge on both Bob and Mary. Ruth writes a list of Bob\\'s four assets: his home, his family, his career, and his freedom, crossing off each one as it is destroyed. With Bob away at Mary\\'s mansion by the sea and the kids at school, she sets the house on fire through various means including tossing two lit cigarettes into a waste basket, microwaving aerosol cans, and overloading an electrical outlet. Ruth takes the family dog, a framed photo of the Patchett family, and - significantly for Ruth\\'s plan of revenge - Bob\\'s file on Mary\\'s finances before leaving as the house explodes in a massive fireball. Ruth then drops the children and dog off at Mary\\'s mansion to live with their father. After seeing in Mary\\'s file that Mary pays for her mother to live in an expensive nursing home, Ruth takes a job there under the pseudonym Vesta Rose, and forms friendships with Mary\\'s estranged mother, Mrs. Fisher , and diminutive co-worker Nurse Hooper . As part of her plan, Ruth gets Mary\\'s mother thrown out of the home, and the latter moves in with her daughter, much to Mary\\'s chagrin. Ruth later partners with Hooper to start the Vesta Rose Employment Agency, which helps downtrodden, socially rejected women find good jobs in exchange for them unwittingly helping Ruth in her quest for vengeance against Bob; one such example is Olivia Honey , whom Bob hires as his secretary. Though Bob falls for Olivia at first sight, he fires her after she confesses her love for him; a heartbroken Olivia reveals to Ruth that Bob wires interest from his clients\\' accounts into an offshore Swiss bank account. Both women break into Bob\\'s firm to wire larger amounts of money from Bob\\'s clients\\' accounts into Bob\\'s Swiss account, making his embezzlement more visible to his clients.

Compounding matters for Mary is the poor reception of her new novel titled \"Love in the Rinse Cycle,\" and learning of Bob\\'s affairs behind her back. However, upon seeing Ute walk off the job and everyone partying around, she finally decides to regain control of her life; she fires Garcia and lays down the law with Bob, the children, and her mother. Mary throws a party that evening to cheer herself up and also spend time with her friends, but police officers show up during the party with a warrant for Bob\\'s arrest.

However, although Jahan may seem all bright and bubbly on the surface, he does have a cross to bear. Jahan’s parents’ split up when he was young, and he now lives with his father and step mother. His relationship with them is far from perfect, as his father is hardly ever at home, while he can’t stand his step mother.

After having been scarred for life during his childhood, because his mother left his father due to financial issues, Babar has deep psychological problems. For him, his friends are his only family and people he can rely on through thick and thin. Rida meanwhile is a self–made young girl who has worked her way through college with a lot of dignity and self-respect.

A trait her friends sometimes find it very hard to deal with. ‘Yariyan’ is the story of how Jahan, Rida and Babar’s friendship is tested as they go through life. Whether it’s Rida’s decision to marry an HIV patient; Jahan’s decision to let Babar look after his newly inherited family business; or the love of Babar’s life, who soon catches Jahan’s eye and becomes the reason he reforms himself; life’s twists and turns make all three friends question their friendship more than once.

       "  'The movie opens with a scene inside a jeweler’s shop, which the main character, Hussein, appears to be attempting to rob. Hussein tries to force The Jeweler, to give him the key to the safe at gunpoint. The Jeweler refuses, and manages to trigger the alarm. Hussein then shoots The Jeweler, and, after some deliberation, takes his own life as well. The rest of the movie proceeds to tell Hussein’s story. The action flashes back to a scene two days before Hussein’s attempted robbery, in which Ali comes to tell Hussein that everything has been cleared for Hussein’s marriage to Ali’s sister, The Bride. A con artist, The Man in the Tea House, then joins them and expounds on the profession of pickpocketing. Hussein, naturally sensitive to his social status, is somewhat offended by the con artist’s automatic classification of him and Ali as mere pickpockets. However, the con artist makes one point which can be taken as something of a universal truth: “If you want to arrest a thief, you’ll have to arrest the world.” Later on, Hussein and Ali attempt to enter the jeweler’s shop and are viciously snubbed by The Jeweler, who literally shuts the doors in their faces. That night, Hussein reports for pizza delivery duty. It appears that Hussein is also dealing with some mental stability issues relating to either his war experience, his medication, or both. His habit of not wearing a helmet while riding his motorbike is one manifestation of this. Hussein first delivers to a man on the 4th floor of a building. Since the elevators are broken, this necessitates him climbing 4 flights of stairs. The man pays Hussein 19000 Tomans for the three pizzas  and tells him to keep the change. When he learns Hussein is a war buddy he gives him a lot more money, feeling sorry for him. His next delivery is the site of a raucous block party in one of the more wealthy districts of Tehran, which has been staked out by the police. The police stop Hussein when he attempts to make the delivery, but don’t allow him to leave until the party has broken up, estimated to be around 4 AM. While Hussein waits, he strikes up a conversation with a young soldier . Despite his uniform and assault rifle, The Soldier is still a child, arguably not ready for the responsibility given him. Since it is obvious that he will not be able to deliver the pizzas, Hussein lets his kinder side show through and hands out pizza to the various police and soldiers on the scene. It is notable that only after the chief accepts a slice do the others accept some as well. The next morning, Hussein, Ali, and The Bride, dress nicely and gain admittance to the jeweler’s shop. They browse among jewelry much too expensive for their means, while Hussein primarily waits to see The Jeweler. When The Jeweler actually shows up, he treats the three with the same condescension and contempt as before, suggesting that they go to a pawnshop to buy handcrafted gold that can be easily liquidated in an emergency, a not-so-subtle reminder of their social status. Hussein, clearly disgusted, takes The Bride home and then goes home himself. Upon arriving at his apartment, the difference between Hussein’s accommodations and those of his clients is fairly obvious. Hussein lays down on his bed and dozes for a while. He is awakened by an arrest in a building close to his, and observes the police drag out a man who loudly and continuously protests his innocence. The police pay no attention, and the class contrast is again seen, this time illustrated by the difference between the treatment of the wealthy and the poor by the police. That night, Hussein again reports for pizza delivery duty. On the way to his destination, Hussein encounters a fellow pizza courier who has been killed in an accident. The destroyed motorbike and sprawled remains of the pizza warmer box are a grim reminder of the dangers of Tehran’s freeways at night. Hussein delivers the pizza to The Rich Man, who lives in an extremely wealthy district. This is exemplified by the fact that as Hussein is on his way up, two young women come down, dressed in essentially Western clothing, something that would not be found in less affluent neighborhoods. He invites Hussein into his spacious apartment. While The Rich Man is otherwise occupied with a phone call with one of the young women Hussein passed coming up, Hussein proceeds to make use of the apartment’s many amenities, including a shave and a short swim. Later, Hussein, obviously drunk, goes out onto The Rich Man’s balcony and surveys the city-scape. The next morning, the scene returns again to the jeweler’s shop. When The Jeweler comes and opens the shop, Hussein forces his way in with a gun and demands to see a specific piece of jewelry. The Jeweler refuses to be pushed around, and Hussein then changes his demand to wanting the key to the safe. The intent is to link this final scene back to the first scene, which culminates with Hussein taking his own life.',\n",

At Christmastime, Sonny stumbles into an affair with Ruth Popper , the depressed, middle-aged wife of his high-school coach, Coach Popper . At the sad little town Christmas dance, Jacy is invited by unsavory Lester Marlow  to a naked indoor pool party at the home of Bobby Sheen , a wealthy boy who seems to offer better prospects than Duane. Since Bobby is not interested in her as long as she is a virgin, she must get someone to have sex with her first. Duane and Sonny go on a road trip to Mexico — which happens entirely off-screen — and return to discover that Sam the Lion , their mentor and father-figure in town, has died of a stroke, leaving a will that bequeaths the town\\'s movie theater to the woman who ran the concession stand, the café to its waitress, Genevieve , and the pool hall to Sonny.

The couple is fetched back to Anarene by her father and mother in separate automobiles.

       "  'Produced by Charles Roven and released by Kings Road Entertainment, the film is set in a post-apocalyptic future, where the wars waged in the 20th century have left the world barren and the past forgotten. Most live from hand to mouth in enclaves known as \"market-towns\" or \"dog-towns\", scrounging out a bare subsistence harvesting hardy crops, raising dogs as food, and trading in trinkets from the past. What little entertainment comes primarily from a brutal sport known as The Game. It is played by bands of roving teams known as juggers, who challenge local teams. They might be considered professional athletes, as they make their living through the tribute paid by the town people, should they defeat the local team. Their trophy is the dog skull from the town. The Game involves two armoured teams of five attempting to score by placing a dog skull on the opposing team\\'s goalpost. One unarmed player - the \"quick\" - runs with the skull while being protected by his/her teammates from attack by the opposing team. However, not all in this time live so sparsely. The Nine Cities, buried deep underground, are home to affluent and powerful members of the aristocracy. Each of The Nine Cities fields its own team of juggers in an organization known as The League, and its membership is maintained with a fresh stream of new players who are proven veterans of the travelling \"dog-town\" games by their collection of trophy skulls. Members of The League live in luxury almost equal to that of aristocrats.

They share regret that none of them has lived up to her high expectations of them. The townspeople are unfriendly with John, the gunfighter, and Tom the gambler. Katie Elder was extremely well liked by everyone in the community, who were all aware of her honesty, her poverty and her undying love for the sons who neglected her. The brothers want to do something for Katie\\'s sake, and their plan is to send youngest son Bud to college, raising money through a sale of another man\\'s herd of horses, even though Bud wants to emulate his eldest brother. Morgan Hastings ([[James Gregory  a gunsmith, claims ownership of the Elders\\' ranch after their father Bass Elder\\'s death, claiming to have won it from him in a game of cards; Bass was afterwards shot in the back, and the killer is still unknown. Hastings hides a hostile attitude towards the brothers and brings in a hired gun, Curley , just in case. Gradually, the Elders suspect foul play. Hastings claimed Bass lost the ranch in a game of Blackjack, while John, in a ruse, states their father wouldn\\'t have been caught dead playing Blackjack, as he decried it as a \"woman\\'s game\" and claimed he would have shot any of his sons that he caught playing it. John\\'s brother privately questioned John\\'s story since they were weaned on Blackjack, and John states that Hastings wouldn\\'t know that, foreshadowing the holes in Hastings\\' story. As it turns out, Hastings had indeed claimed the Elder ranch by murdering Bass Elder. When Hastings learns about the brothers\\' investigations, Hastings frames them for murder of the sheriff  and, not content with seeing them going to prison, arranges an ambush in which Matt is killed and Bud seriously injured. John and Tom take it upon themselves to avenge the family by going after Hastings. John gets him in the end by blowing him up in his own store.  William H.

       "  'Set in the fictional English village of St. Mary Mead, home of Miss Jane Marple , in 1953, a big Hollywood production company arrives to film a costume movie about Mary, Queen of Scots and Elizabeth I with two famous movie stars, Marina Rudd  and Lola Brewster . The two actresses are old rivals who hate each other. Marina, who is making a much heralded comeback after a prolonged \"illness\" and retirement, when she, in reality, has had a nervous breakdown, and her husband, Jason Rudd , who is directing the movie they are making, arrive with their entourage. When she learns that Lola will be in the movie as well, she becomes enraged and vents her anger. Lola and her husband, Martin N. \"Marty\" Fenn , who is producing the movie they are making, then arrive. Excitement runs high in St. Mary Mead, as the locals have been invited to a reception held by the movie company in a manor house, Gossington Hall, to meet the celebrities. Lola and Marina come face to face at the reception and exchange some potent and comical insults, nasty one-liners, as they smile and pose for the cameras. The two square off in a series of hilarious and cleverly written and performed cat-fights throughout the movie. Marina however, has been receiving anonymous death threats. After her initial exchange with Lola at the reception, she is cornered by a gushing, devoted fan, Heather Badcock , who bores her with a long and detailed story about having actually met Marina in person during World War II. After recounting the meeting they had all those years ago, when she arose from her sickbed to go and meet the glamorous star, Babcock drinks a cocktail that was made for Marina and quickly dies from poisoning. The incident is unfortunate for Marina\\'s mental state, and she is beside herself. Everyone is certain she was the intended murder victim. Once filming begins on the movie, she discovers that apart from threatening notes made up of newspaper clippings, her cup of coffee on the set has also been spiked with poison, sending her into fits of terror. The police detective from Scotland Yard investigating the case, Inspector Dermot Craddock , is baffled as he tries to uncover who is behind the attempt on the life of the actress and the subsequent murder of the innocent woman. The suspected are Ella Zielinsky , Jason\\'s production assistant who is secretly having an affair with him and would like Marina out of the way, and the hotheaded actress Lola Brewster. Inspector Craddock asks his aunt, the renowned amateur detective Miss Jane Marple, who injured her foot at the reception and is confined to her home, for assistance. The main suspect, Zielinsky, is then killed by a lethal nose spray after going to a pay phone in the village, where she called the murderer and threatened to expose him. Miss Marple, now back on her feet, visits Gossington Hall, where Marina and Jason are staying, and views where Babcock\\'s death occurred. Working from information received from her cleaning woman, Cherry Baker (played by [[Wendy Morgan , who was working as a waitress the day of the murder, the determined elderly sleuth begins to piece together the events of the fatal reception and solves the mystery. By the time she has collected all the evidence to indicate who committed the crime, however, another death occurs at Gossington Hall, which sadly closes the case on who the murderer in St. Mary Mead actually is: Marina Rudd, who has apparently committed suicide. In the film\\'s denouement, Miss Marple explains the murders that have occurred. Heather Babcock\\'s story was Marina\\'s initial motive. Ms. Babcock suffered from German measles — a rather harmless disease to most adults, but problematic for a pregnant woman. Heather Babcock innocently infected Marina when she met her during World War Two. Marina was pregnant at the time; the disease caused her child to be born with mental retardation. Upon hearing Heather cheerfully tell this story, Marina was overcome with rage and poisoned her without thinking. She then spread the idea that she was the intended victim, delivering the death threats and poisoning her own coffee. Ella, who made phone calls to various suspects from the pay phone, accidentally guessed correctly, prompting Marina to murder her. As Marina is now dead, she will not be brought to justice. Jason, her devoted husband, confesses to Miss Marple that he actually administered the dosage of poison to save her from prosecution. However, Marina didn\\'t touch the hot chocolate he made for her and rather poisoned herself.',\n",

       "  'In an edit added to the film before public release, a comment by Henry L. Stimson, the Secretary of War at the time, was quoted to create trust with the audience, “the purpose of these films is to give factual information as to the causes, the events leading up to our entry into the war and the principles for which we are fighting.” The purpose of the OWI was to use mass communication to sell the war and to define Americans\\' perception of the reality of war; therefore, they released Prelude to War to further these goals.Kurash, J. \"A Prelude to War\" . Retrieved from http://www.army.mil The film commences with an explanation of how Americans were brought into the war through heroic motives to protect countries unable to protect themselves. America had this duty to righteousness and Christian values throughout history, according to the values and beliefs set forth by the founding fathers.Wilkins, J.N. America’s Christian FoundationGerman, Kathleen. “Frank Capra’s Why We Fight Series and the American Audience.” Western Journal of Speech Communication 54. : 237–248. The documentary makes use of compare and contrast methods throughout the film in order to transmit its heroic message. The primary images used within the film to portray the opponents of America are introduced by Henry Wallace as the “free world”&nbsp;— a brightly-illuminated planet of the Allies, and a “slave world” as a planet deep in shadow of the Axis Powers. It examines the differences between this free, democratic state and the slave, fascist state represented by Benito Mussolini, Adolf Hitler and Yamamoto working together as gangsters to conquer the world. In order to do this, Capra made use of footage from Triumph of the Will, but with different narration designed to support the Allied cause. It is brought to the audience’s attention that after the Nazis smashed the opposing political parties and labor unions they turned their attention to their last remaining obstacle&nbsp;— the church. In one scene a stained glass window is shattered by several bricks to reveal a “Heil Hitler!” poster behind. To emphasize this depiction of Hitler as an antichrist figure, a class of German schoolchildren is shown singing: Adolf Hitler is our Saviour, our heroHe is the noblest being in the whole wide world.For Hitler we live,For Hitler we die.Our Hitler is our LordWho rules a brave new world.',\n",

Shortly after her return, her father, Shigeyuki , leaves for a business trip abroad in Singapore, leaving her with her 19-year-old younger brother Koichi . Haruka discovers one morning that her wheelchair has moved despite the wheels being locked. Believing it to be a burglary incident, Koichi begins setting up video cameras to catch the suspect. After discovering the wheelchair has moved again and all the windows had been locked, Koichi suspects it related to a paranormal force. Against Haruka's frightened pleas, he places a mound of salt in her room, which becomes scattered by morning. Koichi begins to investigate even further, to which Haruka disapproves of. After one of their drinking glasses break during dinner, Haruka reluctantly lets Koichi mount a video camera in her room. The camera records the demon entering Haruka's room and drawing her sheets. Koichi's friend Jun Nagoshi  visits the next day with his girlfriend Mai Yaguchi , who brings her friend Misuzu Kure  along as well. Misuzu remarks feeling a strange presence at the Yamanos' house, and curious, Koichi asks if she can investigate the demon haunting Haruka. After examining Haruka's room, Misuzu claims she has never felt a presence like the demon's before and suddenly plugs her ears, screaming. At night, Haruka wakes up to the spirit touching her, but Koichi finds nothing. Koichi and Haruka invite a Shinto priest over to their house to perform an exorcism . The priest believes the demon has settled down and assures the two that they have nothing to fear. The night progresses with no incidents, and by morning, Shigeyuki comes home from his business trip. On night 12, Haruka's wheelchair moves towards the camera and cuts it off. Haruka and Koichi review the footage and realize that the demon has not gone and is angry. Koichi phones Shigeyuki's office for help, but is told that he did not show up for work. The next night, the events worsen when Haruka is violently dragged out of bed by her hair via a force she reports to be under her bed. Koichi tries contacting the Shinto priest from the purification ceremony, but is told the priest died of a heart attack after leaving the ceremony. The two siblings debate on leaving the house and still receive no news from Shigeyuki when they call his cellular phone. Haruka tells Koichi to escape without her if the demon attacks them both. When night falls, Haruka recalls Katie, a woman involved in the same car accident that cut her trip short, and after searching her name on the Internet, believes that the demon that had possessed her is now targeting her. She reveals to Koichi that she experienced similar strange phenomena while recuperating in the hospital in America. Once Koichi leaves her room, he hears her screaming and finds her in the yard downstairs in her wheelchair. Haruka claims that the demon is tormenting her from behind and reveals a strange bite mark on her arm before losing consciousness. Koichi watches Haruka for the rest of the night and, in the morning, places a crucifix in her hand. After he leaves the room, Haruka drops the crucifix and it moves along the floor before combusting. Several windows break spontaneously in the room and Haruka does not awaken during any of this. On night 15, Haruka wakes up at 1 AM, walks to Koichi's room, and stares at him while he is asleep. Around 3 AM, she walks downstairs and wakes Koichi with a scream. Alarmed, Koichi runs to the living room, where he discovers Shigeyuki's corpse lying in one of the closets. A possessed Haruka appears and knocks away the camera in his hand. She violently throws Koichi at the camera in his room and slowly approaches him, but Koichi escapes and boards a taxi outside of his house. As the taxi drives away, Haruka suddenly appears in front of it, and the taxi collides into her before slamming into a wall. The crash kills the driver while Koichi survives the accident. Later, Koichi goes to a funeral home to pay respects to the dead taxi driver. However, he is suddenly dragged into the darkness screaming. After the camera cuts to black, the camera begins running again, and Haruka is seen slowly staring up at it. An epilogue text states that Koichi was found dead, Shigeyuki's body was discovered in the house later, and Haruka's whereabouts remain unknown.\",\n",

       "  ' United States Air Force Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper  is commander of Burpelson Air Force Base, which houses the SAC B-52 airborne alert bomber force just hours from the Soviet border. Ripper orders his executive officer, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake of the RAF , to put the base on alert, asserting that it is not a drill. The alert is sent to the patrolling aircraft, including one piloted by Aircraft commander Major T. J. \"King\" Kong  and his crew. All the aircraft commence an attack flight on Russia, and lock out unauthorized external communications through the CRM 114 Discriminator. Mandrake discovers that no order for war has been received, and tries to stop Ripper, who locks them both in his office. Ripper reveals to Mandrake that he believes the Soviets have been using fluoridation of United States\\' water supplies to pollute the \"precious bodily fluids\" of Americans. At The Pentagon, General Buck Turgidson  briefs President Merkin Muffley  in the \"War Room\" along with several other top officers and aides about the attack. Muffley is shocked to learn that such orders could be given without his authorization, although he had OK\\'ed this in the case of Soviet first-strike attack on Washington D.C. Turgidson reports that his men are trying to cycle through every CRM code to issue the stand-down order but this could take over two days. Muffley orders Turgidson to storm the base and seize Ripper, though Turgidson warns that Ripper may have already alerted his men to this possibility. Gen. Turgidson attempts to convince Muffley to let the attack continue, as their first strike on the Soviets would wipe out the majority of the Soviet missiles, and the little they could retaliate with would only cost a few million American lives. Muffley refuses, and instead brings in the Soviet ambassador Alexei de Sadeski  to get Soviet premier Dimitri Kisov on the \"Hot Line\". The President alerts the Premier to the situation, and authorizes the USSR to fire upon the US planes to stop the attack. After a heated discussion, the ambassador explains that the Soviet Union has created a doomsday device consisting of 50 buried bombs with \"Cobalt Thorium G\" set to detonate should any nuclear attack strike their country; the Soviets had conceived of this after reading a New York Times article claiming the United States was also working on such a device. The President\\'s wheelchair-bound scientific advisor, a sinister German named Dr. Strangelove , considers that this is a ploy, as a secret doomsday device would be an ineffectual deterrent. Sadeski admits they had plans to reveal its existence the following week, as a surprise for the Premier\\'s birthday.  U.S. Army airborne forces arrive at Burpelson, but as predicted, the base\\'s troops consider the troops to be Soviets in disguise and open fire. Despite many casualties, the Army forces eventually overtake the base. Before he can be restrained, Ripper shoots himself. Colonel \"Bat\" Guano  forces his way into Ripper\\'s office. He initially suspects Mandrake of being an enemy, but Mandrake convinces him otherwise. Mandrake has identified the proper recall code for the bombers from Ripper\\'s desk blotter doodles, and SAC is able to contact the bomber planes and send them away from Soviet air space. The War Room celebrates. However, Sadeski reports that of the four planes that the Soviets had believed shot down, they cannot account for one of them - that of Major Kong. Anti-aircraft fire had ruptured the fuel tank and caused the CRM aboard Kong\\'s plane to self-destruct, leaving the crew no way to receive the counter-order. President Muffley gives the plane\\'s original destination to the Soviets, to allow them to concentrate on finding it. However, due to the fuel loss, Major Kong has changed the destination to a closer high-priority target, a ICBM complex at Kodlosk. On approaching the new target, the crew discovers that the bomb release mechanism has been damaged. Major Kong tries to repair the damage, but ends up falling out of the plane along with the bomb; he straddles the bomb and rides it like a rodeo cowboy as it falls and detonates. While discussing the aftereffects of the activation of the doomsday device, Sadeski notes that, within ten months, the surface of the earth will be uninhabitable. Dr. Strangelove recommends that the President gather several hundreds of thousands of people, with a high female-to-male ratio, to live in deep mineshafts in order to escape the radiation, and to then institute a breeding program to allow the United States to repopulate the surface after a hundred years have passed. Gen. Turgidson warns that the Soviets will likely do the same. At this point, Dr. Strangelove suddenly shouts that he has a plan, and miraculously gets up from his wheelchair, takes a few halting steps and shouts, \"Mein Führer! I can walk!\" The film then cuts to a montage of nuclear detonations, accompanied by Vera Lynn\\'s recording of \"We\\'ll Meet Again.\"',\n",

       "  'Basil  is a half-English half-Greek writer who has been raised in Britain and bears all the hallmarks of an uptight, middle-class Englishman. He is waiting at a port in mainland Greece one day when he meets a gruff, yet enthusiastic peasant and musician named Zorba . Basil explains to Zorba that he is traveling to a rural Cretan village where his father owns some land, with the intention of opening up a lignite mine and perhaps curing his writer\\'s block. Zorba relates his experience with mining and convinces Basil to take him along. When they arrive at Crete, they take a car to the village where they are greeted enthusiastically by the town\\'s impoverished peasant community. They stay with an old, French war widow named Madame Hortense  in her self-styled \"Hotel Ritz\". The ever audacious Zorba tries to persuade Basil into making a move on Madame Hortense, but when he is reluctant, Zorba instead seizes the opportunity, and they form a relationship. Over the next few days, Basil and Zorba attempt to work the old lignite mine, but find it too unsafe and shut it down. Zorba then has an idea to use the forest opposite as a kind of logging area , however the land is owned by the powerful monastery of the village, so Zorba goes over there and befriends the monks by getting them drunk. Afterwards, he comes home to Basil and begins to dance in a way that mesmerizes Basil. Meanwhile, Basil and Zorba get their first introduction to \"the Widow\" , a young, widowed woman, who is incessantly teased by the townspeople for not remarrying, especially to a young, local boy who is madly in love with her, but whom she has spurned repeatedly. One rainy afternoon, Basil offers her his umbrella, which she reluctantly takes. Zorba suggests that she is attracted to him, but Basil, ever shy, denies this and refuses to pursue the widow. Basil hands Zorba some money, as he sends him off to the nearby town of Chania, where Zorba is to buy cable and other supplies for the implementation of his grand plan. Zorba says goodbye to Basil and Madame Hortense, who is by now madly in love with him. While in Chania, Zorba entertains himself at a cabaret and strikes up a brief romance with a much younger dancer. In a letter to Basil, he details his exploits and indicates that he has found love. Angered by Zorba\\'s apparent irresponsibility and the squandering of his money, Basil untruthfully tells Madame Hortense that Zorba has declared his love to her and intends to marry her upon his return — to which she is ecstatic to the point of tears. Meanwhile, the Widow returns Basil\\'s umbrella by way of Mimithos , the simple-minded village idiot. When Zorba eventually returns with supplies and gifts, he is surprised and angered to hear about Basil\\'s lie to Madame Hortense. He also asks Basil concerning his whereabouts the night before. That night, Basil had finally gone to the Widow\\'s house, made love to her and spent the night. The brief encounter comes at great cost. A villager catches sight of them, and word spreads, until the young, local boy who is in love with the Widow is taunted mercilessly about it. The next morning, the villagers find his body by the sea, where he has drowned himself out of shame. The boy\\'s father holds a funeral which all the villagers attend. The widow attempts to come inconspicuously, but is blocked from entering the church. She is eventually trapped in the courtyard, where she is beaten and stoned by the villagers, who hold her responsible for the young boy\\'s suicide. Basil, meek and fearful of intervening, tells Mimithos to quickly fetch Zorba. Zorba arrives just as a villager, a friend of the boy, tries to pull a knife and kill the widow. Zorba overpowers the much younger man and disarms him. Thinking that the situation is now under control, Zorba asks the Widow to follow him and turns his back. At that moment, the dead boy\\'s father pulls his knife and cuts the widow\\'s throat. She dies instantly, as the villagers shuffle away apathetically, whisking the father away. Only Basil, Zorba and Mimithos show any emotion at her murder. Basil proclaims his inability to intervene whereupon Zorba laments the futility of death. On a rainy day, Basil and Zorba come home and find Madame Hortense waiting for them. She expresses anger at Zorba for making no progress on the wedding. Zorba conjures up a story that he has ordered a white satin wedding dresses, lined with pearls and adorned with real gold. Madame Hortense pulls out two golden rings she had made and proposes their immediate engagement. Zorba tries to delay, but eventually agrees and goes along with gusto, to Basil\\'s surprise. A while later, Madame Hortense who apparently has contracted pneumonia, is seen on her deathbed. Zorba stays by her side, along with Basil. Meanwhile, word gets round that \"the foreigner\" is dying, and that since she has no heirs, the State will take all her possessions and money. The desperately poor villagers crowd around her hotel, impatiently waiting for her demise so they can steal her belongings. Two old ladies enter her room and gaze expectantly at her, hoping to get first hands on all her belongings. Other women try to enter and raid her belongings, but Zorba can fight them off. In an instant of her death, the women re-enter Madame Hortense\\'s bedroom to steal her most valued belongings. Zorba leaves with a sigh, as the hotel is ransacked and stripped bare by the shrieking and excited villagers. When Zorba returns to Madame Hortense\\'s bedroom, the entire room is stripped bare apart from her bed  and the bird in her birdcage. Zorba takes the birdcage with him. Finally, Zorba\\'s elaborate contraption to ferry timber down the hill is complete. A festive ceremony is held, and all the villagers have turned out to see it. After a blessing from the local priests, Zorba gives the signal to start by firing a rifle in the air. A log comes hurtling down the zip line at a worrying pace, destroying the log itself and slightly damaging part of the contraption. Zorba remains unconcerned and gives orders for a second log. This one also speeds down and shoots straight into the sea. By now the villagers and priests have become fearful and run for cover. Zorba remains unfazed and orders a third log, which accelerates down with such violence that it dislodges the entire contraption, destroying everything the men had worked for. The villagers flee, leaving only Basil and Zorba behind. Basil and Zorba sit by the shore to eat a rack of lamb for lunch. Zorba pretends to tell the future from the lamb shank, saying that he foresees a great journey to a big city. He then asks Basil directly when he plans to leave, and Basil replies that he will leave in a few days. Zorba declares his sadness about Basil\\'s now imminent return to England and tells Basil that he is missing madness. Basil asks Zorba to teach him how to dance. Zorba teaches him the sirtaki and Basil begins to laugh hysterically at the catastrophic contraption. The story ends with both men enthusiastically dancing the sirtaki on the beach.',\n",
       "  \"Private Manning is a soldier who, in order to survive, does just enough to stay out of trouble, but not enough to actually make a difference. Through the sheer bloodiness of the Hurtgen battles, Manning is left as the sole survivor of his platoon and is subsequently promoted to sergeant. He tries to get out of it, saying he is unqualified for the position, but his company commander, Captain Roy Pritchett, thinks otherwise. Manning then tries to back out of responsibility by asking to be filed on a Section 8 , but is refused. Manning now finds himself in charge of a squad of replacements, a prospect he is less than thrilled with. He meets with his new men, and during the evening, leads them into position on the line. The next morning, on patrol with his squad, Manning puts Private Warren Sanderson on point. Sanderson goes forward too quickly, getting lost and then narrowly avoids contact with the enemy. After some time, Manning decides that they must leave without Sanderson. At that moment, Sanderson returns. After the incident, Manning is scorned by his peers and berated by his platoon leader, First Lieutenant Terrence Lukas. His company makes a push toward the town of Schmidt, to take and hold a bridge. However, they move into an enemy minefield and are shelled by 88s. They retreat and Pritchett comes to Manning with a mission that he requires volunteers for. Manning wishes him luck, so Pritchett offers Manning a Section 8 if he volunteers for the mission. During the mission, one of his men, Private Sam Baxter, decides to run away, prompting the rest of the men to do the same. He shoots Baxter, hitting the flamethrower he is carrying on his back, which causes it to explode and burns the soldier to death. Although the rest of his men are horrified by this, they stop running and assault the position where the two 88s are located, led by a crazed Sanderson, armed with another flamethrower. Meanwhile, his company secures the bridge, suffering horrendous casualties, and after the 88s are put out of action, get shelled by German tanks. In the assault, Lukas is overcome with stress, and then, Sergeant Patrick Talbot, gives him a handful of dog tags from the dead soldiers in their platoon. When the battalion's commander, Lieutenant Colonel George Rickman, asks about the status of his platoon, Lukas snaps and assaults him. Manning confronts Rickman as Lukas is carried away, picking up the mass of dog tags Lukas dropped, and pressing them against Rickman's chest. Through Manning's insubordination, Rickman recognizes him and orders him to his command post. Manning is subsequently promoted to second lieutenant and given a platoon. After an altercation with Talbot and Manning's friend, Corporal Toby Chamberlain, who is the platoon's medic, in which they confront him for shooting his own man, Manning tells them of a plan to destroy the German tanks the night before the assault. Chamberlain states they have no proof that Manning will not just shoot them, as he did Baxter, then Private Sanderson — who survived the raid on the 88mm cannons — defends Manning's conduct by acknowledging the fact that everybody would have run instead of fighting. Manning also silences them by telling them that their company is making another push in the morning, which will be more dangerous. If they don't attack the tanks, he knows that the entire battalion is in jeopardy. He leads the three men  in a pre-dawn raid on the German tanks. Manning clears the minefield and cuts the wire, enabling the group to continue on. The operation costs the lives of all but Manning and Sanderson — while Manning gets wounded. The film concludes with a wounded Manning being carried back to the American lines by the now battle-hardened Sanderson; a mirror image of his carrying back a wounded comrade at the opening of the film; Manning appears to die. The film closes with a little note that the Battle of the Hurtgen Forest was overshadowed by the Battle of the Bulge quite soon after.\",\n",

Immediately afterwards, the old woman's Daughter  claims to have delivered the baby herself in a virgin birth. She imprisons the Mother and begins to exploit the Baby by selling blessings to the desperate townspeople of Mâcon. The Church is both suspicious and jealous. The Bishop's Son , a believer in science and a sceptic, doubts the Daughter. She attempts to convince him that she is indeed a virgin by offering her virginity to him. Before the Bishop's Son is able to consummate with the Daughter, the Baby commands a bull to kill him. The Bishop  arrives as his son has been gored, and blame for his son's death falls onto the Daughter. The Bishop takes custody of the Baby and the Church begins exploiting him, and the town's faith, far more than the Daughter. In response, the Daughter quietly suffocates the Baby. The Bishop sentences her to death, but because she is still a virgin, she cannot be killed outright. The Daughter is instead sentenced to be raped 208 times, after which she is to be executed. But after the rapes she is found to be dead. The Church then dismembers the Baby's body and sells his remains as religious relics to the townspeople. Famine falls once again onto the city of Mâcon.\",\n",

By the side of a cliff, they see a strange memorial with evidence of a plate missing and with the name \"Annwyn\"  marked on it. A local man Dafydd  explains that, according to traditional Welsh mythology, Annwyn is a sort of afterlife. Later, Sarah vanishes on the beach, and another similar looking girl, named Ebrill  , appears in her place. Ebrill is the long-dead daughter of a local shepherd who also served as the town\\'s pastor fifty years prior. When Ebrill, who was a sickly child, died, her father gave her to the ocean, sending her to Annwyn. He then convinced his followers to throw themselves into the ocean, claiming that it was the way to Paradise, while he privately hoped that their sacrifice would return Ebrill to him from Annwyn. Ebrill did come back, but, as the film states, something came back with her. That something killed the sheep, something upon which the local newspapers remarked upon. Her father tried to draw the evil out of her, through trepanning and locking her in her room. Dafydd was one of the followers who did not throw himself off the cliff, though both his parents did. Ebrill\\'s father took him in, and when Dafydd could no longer bear witnessing the shepherd hurting Ebrill, he set her free, which in turn allowed the evil within her to lash out and shove her father over the cliff. Realizing that Ebrill never should have been brought back from Annwyn, a young Dafydd sent her back by drowning her. Adele makes the connection that Ebrill is back once more because she has found a living substitute in Sarah, hence the film\\'s tagline \"One of the living for one of the dead\". In an attempt to rescue her daughter, Adele throws both herself and Ebrill over the cliffs, despite James\\' protests, and sends them both to Annwyn, a sepia-toned, misty version of reality.

Ebrill informs her that the dead don\\'t get second chances. Ebrill and her father perform trepannation on Adele, to draw out the evil within her.

In unlocking the door, Adele is able to rescue Sarah from Annwyn, though, in doing so, Adele sacrificed herself, only to realize too late that the Sarah she brought back was tainted by the same evil that had tainted Ebrill all those years ago.',\n",

He then interacts with a distraught woman who has hit a deer, and is being driven to distraction by the fact that she continually hits deer while commuting, no matter how hard she tries to avoid them. She drives away in a tearful huff, and Alvin, who had started to run short of food, cooks and eats the deer, then mounts the antlers above the rear doorway of his trailer as a tribute to the deer and the human sustenance it had provided. In the next scene, Alvin\\'s brakes fail as he travels down a steep hill; he struggles to maintain control of the speeding tractor and finally manages to bring the vehicle to a complete stop. Some townspeople help get Alvin\\'s mower and trailer off the road. They later discover that the mower also has transmission problems. Now beginning to run low on cash, Alvin borrows a cordless phone from a homeowner - gently but resolutely refusing an invitation to come indoors - and calls Rose to ask her to send him his Social Security check. He then leaves money on the doorstep to pay for his long-distance telephone call. A local motorist offers Alvin a ride the rest of the way to Lyle\\'s, but Alvin declines, stating that he prefers to travel his own way. An elderly war veteran takes him into town for a drink, and Alvin tells a story about how he is haunted by a memory of accidentally shooting one of his military comrades. Alvin\\'s tractor is fixed and he is presented with an exorbitant bill by the mechanics, who are twins and are constantly bickering. Alvin successfully negotiates the price down, and explains his mission, which he calls \\'a hard swallow to [my] pride\\', but \\'A brother is a brother. \\' The mechanic twins seem to relate to this, realizing that they should make peace, also. Later, Alvin camps in a cemetery and chats with a priest. The priest recognizes Lyle\\'s name and is aware of his stroke. The priest says that Lyle did not mention that he had a brother. Alvin replies that \\'neither one of us has had a brother for quite some time.\\' Alvin wants to make peace with Lyle and is emphatic that whatever happened ten years ago does not matter anymore. \"I say, \\'Amen\\' to that, Brother\" the priest replies. The next obstacle that Alvin must overcome is apparent engine trouble, just a few miles from Lyle\\'s house. Alvin stops in the middle of the road, unsure of how to proceed. A large farm tractor driving by then stops to help, but fortunately this time the problem was evidently just a few drops of bad gas, because the lawn-tractor\\'s engine sputters to life again after sitting for a few minutes. The gracious farmer then leads the way on his own tractor, and drives along slowly ahead of Alvin during the final leg of his journey to make sure he gets there okay. Lyle\\'s house is dilapidated. Using his two canes, Alvin makes his way to the door. He calls for his brother. At first Lyle does not appear and Alvin expresses relief when he does. The two brothers make contact, one with a walker and one with two canes. Lyle invites Alvin to sit down. Lyle looks at Alvin\\'s mower-tractor contraption and asks if Alvin has ridden that thing just to see him. Lyle is moved. The two men sit and look at the stars, as they had done as children.',\n",

Sreekanth arrives too late, and returns home to find that Parvati had never gone out of the house that night! With her revenge now complete, Tantrik orders Gowri to leave, but she says that she wants to take her beloved Ananthu with her, and goes as Parvati to kill him and take his spirit away. Sreekanth runs to the hill where Parvati is about to jump off the hill with a reluctant Ananthu, and manages to put a protective bangle on this hand,thus dis-powering Parvati. Parvati is then taken to the tantrik, and he drives Gowri's spirit out of her. The spirit bids goodbye to Parvati,and she returns to normal. The film ends with Parvati joining school again with the old classmates.\",\n",

       "  'Dana Scully , a former FBI agent, is now a staff physician at a Catholic hospital; she is treating Christian, a young boy with Sandhoff disease. FBI agent Mosely Drummy  approaches Scully for help in locating her former partner, Fox Mulder , who has been in hiding as a fugitive since the events of the series finale. Drummy states that the FBI will call off its manhunt for Mulder if he helps investigate the disappearances of several women in Virginia, the latest of whom is a young FBI agent named Monica Bannan . Scully agrees and convinces a reluctant Mulder to help. The duo is taken to Washington, D.C., where Agent Dakota Whitney  wants Mulder\\'s expertise with the paranormal as they have been led to a clue—a severed human arm—by Father Joeseph Fitzgerald Crissman . He is a former priest defrocked for the child molestation of thirty-seven altar boys, and claims God is sending him visions of the crimes. Whitney and Drummy take Father Joe and Mulder to the kidnapped Bannan\\'s home, where the former priest overcomes the others\\' skepticism when, in anguish and on his knees in inexplicable pain, he begins to bleed from his eyes. A second woman, driving home after swimming in a natatorium, is run off the road by a truck driven by Janke Dacyshyn , who then abducts her. Father Joe is again recruited for help with the second abducted woman. After a grueling nighttime search in a snow covered field, he leads the FBI to what turns out to be a frozen burial ground of people and body parts. Analysis of the remains, and a car crash of a recent missing person, eventually leads them to Dacyshyn, an organ transporter in Richmond, Virginia, and his husband, Franz Tomczeszyn  who was among the youths Father Joe sexually abused. Later, Scully goes to Father Joe\\'s apartment to confront him about his religious visions, particularly the cryptic message he directed to her: \"Don\\'t give up.\" To her despair, he says he knows nothing more about those visions than what he had told the FBI, and then collapses suffering a seizure, as we are shown at the same moment Tomczeszyn—who now possesses an extremely feminine arm—begins to suffer a seizure too. Scully calls for an ambulance, and later learns that Father Joe, who is admitted to Our Lady of Sorrows, suffers from advanced lung cancer. During an FBI raid on the organ donor facility where Dacyshyn works, he ends up escaping, leaving Bannan\\'s severed head at the scene. Mulder, who accompanied Whitney on the raid, chases Dacyshyn to a building construction site. Whitney follows, and is killed when Dacyshyn pushes her down an elevator shaft. Scully, seeking a resolution, asks Joe, who has not yet heard of the discovery of Bannan\\'s head, if he senses that she is still alive. He replies that she is. Discouraged but still determined, Mulder decides to investigate the incidents further. He starts by driving Scully\\'s car to Nutter\\'s Feed Store in a small town near the abductions, as the human remains contain acepromazine, an animal tranquilizer. When Dacyshyn coincidentally arrives moments later, Mulder slips out and follows him. Dacyshyn notices him, however, and runs the car off the road. Mulder survives and manages to tail Dacyshyn, who must exit his truck after the engine fails, to a small compound in a former barn. Mulder enters, and the commotion caused by a two-headed guard dog\\'s attack brings Dacyshyn out from one of the buildings. The compound is for a makeshift east-European medical team that has been murdering people and stealing their organs for years. The field where Father Joe had earlier discovered the bodies turned out to be their dumping ground. Mulder enters the building to find that the team has been using the organs and body parts in an attempt to keep Tomczeszyn alive; at the moment they are attempting to place Tomczeszyn\\'s head on the body of the second abducted woman, and the stitching makes it clear this is not the first time they have tried this. Mulder tries to save her from the gruesome fate, but a doctor comes from behind and injects him with tranquilizer. Helpless, Mulder is taken outside to be murdered by Dacyshyn. When Scully cannot reach Mulder on his cell phone, she calls Agent Drummy, who refuses to help her. Undaunted, she next contacts her old FBI superior, Director Walter Skinner , for help. They triangulate the phone\\'s location and find Scully\\'s wrecked car, eventually making their way through the snow to find a rural mailbox whose address, 25-2, corresponds to a Biblical chapter and verse, Proverbs 25:2, from which Father Joe had quoted to Scully before having the seizure. They race to the address where Mulder is about to be axed by Dacyshyn. Scully attacks him in an ensuing confrontation, incapacitating him, while Skinner breaks up the medical procedure before the young woman is beheaded. Later, Mulder is at home when Scully tells him Father Joe has died. It happened at the same moment, Mulder notes, that Scully disconnected the life support to Tomczeszyn\\'s severed head. Somehow, he surmises, the two men\\'s fates were linked by more than just visions. Scully remains troubled by Father Joe\\'s advice, \"Don\\'t give up\", and expresses doubts about Christian\\'s surgery, due to the words of a molesting priest. Mulder comforts her, suggesting that they can leave—and get as far away from the darkness as possible. When the moment of surgery comes, however, Scully pauses a moment, turns and sees three nuns, and then forges ahead with the risky procedure. In a post-credits scene, Mulder and Scully are seen rowing towards a tropical island, wearing swimsuits, and waving to a helicopter hovering overhead.',\n",

Meanwhile, Tiger\\'s girlfriend Miss Kitty leaves him to find a new life out West, tired of the life of an alley cat, and remarking that perhaps she\\'s looking for a cat that is \"more like a dog.\" In the alleys, a regal feline named Cat R. Waul devises a plan to deliver the mice into his clutches. He first launches a full-scale cat attack to drive all the mice to the sewers, specifically ordering his fellow cats to not eat any of them. Using a mouse-cowpoke marionette, he then entices the neighborhood mice, including the Mousekewitzs, into moving to a better life out west. Tiger chases the train, trying to catch up with his friends, but is thrown off course by a pack of angry dogs. While on the west-bound train, Fievel wanders into the livestock car, where he overhears the cats revealing their plot to turn them into \"mouse burgers.\" After being discovered, Fievel is thrown from the train by Cat R. Waul\\'s hench-spider, T.R. Chula, landing the mouse in the middle of the desert. The Mousekewitzes are heartbroken once again over the loss of Fievel and arrive at Green River with heavy hearts. Upon arrival at Green River, the Mousekewitzs begin to find a suitable home, positive that their son Fievel would find them once again. Papa helps his family set up a home under an old water tower, explaining while other mice would scamper for a land to live in, a smart mouse would live closer to water in the dusty country. However, Chula soon blocks up the water tower, drying up the river. Cat R. Waul approaches the mice and proposes to build a better community where cats and mice can live together in peace. Meanwhile, Fievel is wandering aimlessly through the desert, as is Tiger, who has found his way out west as well, and the two pass each other. However, each one figures that the other is a mirage and they continue on their separate ways. Tiger is captured by a tribe of Native American mice and their leader hails him as a deity, after seeing how Tiger looks like a rock formation. Fievel is picked up by a hawk and dropped over the Native American mouse village when their fireworks scare and explode on the bird, making his feathers pop out of his body, reuniting Fievel with Tiger. Tiger chooses to stay in the village while Fievel catches a passing tumbleweed, which takes him to Green River. As soon as Fievel makes his arrival, he quickly reunites with his family. He then tries to expose Cat R. Waul\\'s true intentions, but the mouse inhabitants are oblivious to the danger. Inside a local saloon that is under construction, Fievel learns of the cats\\' real plan before he is discovered. He confronts Cat R. Waul and is almost eaten in the process. However, Cat R. Waul is distracted when Tanya, Fievel\\'s older sister, sings while working and is enchanted by her voice. He sends Tanya to Miss Kitty, who\\'s now a diva, and she reveals that she came out west at the request of Cat R. Waul - an action she now seems to regret. Cat R Waul tells Miss Kitty to put Tanya on stage. With a little encouragement from Miss Kitty, Tanya performs to positive feedback. Meanwhile, Fievel is chased by Chula and briefly taken prisoner, but escapes. While walking out of town, Fievel stops to talk with an old hound sleeping outside the jail, discovering that the saturnine dog is in fact the legendary Wylie Burp he looked up to back in New York. Fievel convinces Wylie to help the mice\\'s plight. Wylie asks him to find a dog for him to train, but he instead recruits Tiger to be trained as a lawman and as a dog. Tiger is reluctant at first, but relents at the suggestion that a new persona might win back Miss Kitty. After an eventually successful training session to work on Tiger\\'s skills, the trio go back to Green River to fight the cats, who had scheduled to kill the mice at sunset. At Green River, a giant mousetrap has been disguised as bleachers for a ceremony honoring the opening of Cat R. Waul\\'s saloon. But before the trap can be tripped, the three foil the plot using their wits and their slingshots to combat Cat R. Waul\\'s feline henchmen. Tanya and Ms. Kitty soon learn of Cat R. Waul\\'s true intentions and gets the rest of the mice to get off the trap. But towards the end of the fight, Chula captures Ms. Kitty as hostage, threatening to drop her from the tower. Tiger is enraged and overcomes his Arachnophobia by unleashing his \"inner dog\" to save Ms. Kitty and using a pitchfork and Chula\\'s web as a lasso with the spider trapped on it, and then hurtles Cat R. Waul and his gang out of town by using the mouse trap. The cats fly into the air, then land into a mailbag. A passing train picks up the bag and leaves, and Cat R. Waul gets reluctantly adopted by a passenger. Enchanted by his new personality, Miss Kitty and Tiger are reunited. Tanya becomes a famous singer  and the water tower flows with water again, making Green River bloom with flowers. As the mice celebrate their freedom from the cats, Fievel finds Wylie Burp walking away from the party to watch the sunset on the prairie and joins him. Wylie hands Fievel his sheriff badge, although Fievel is unsure about taking it, since he feels he is not a traditional hero, but Wylie reminds him that, if it were not for Fievel, he would still be a washed up dog.

Soon after the funeral, cousin Tzimis rings Steve Karamitsis to announce he has inherited a beach worth 2.5 million euros, a tavern and a small house on the Greek resort island of Mykonos from his uncle Panos that he had never met.

Cousin Tzimis picks up the two friends from the airport and brings Steve up to speed with local customs and habits. Tzimis and his Spartan wife Voula are managing the tavern Steve has inherited. Steve finds out that to get his inheritance, he must pay 1.1 million euros in tax because he is not an immediate descendant of Panos. Steve does not have that much money.

       "  'The Nun” started out with a young woman in a wedding gown preparing to take her vows of chastity, obedience, and poverty to make herself a nun, but she refused at the last moment and instead begged her parents not to force her to take them. This did not work, and later the young woman, named Suzanne, learned much about her family and her heritage - or her lack thereof. She discovered that her mother’s husband was not her father, and that her mother is shutting her up in the convent because she didn’t want her husband to know that the girl was not his daughter. She also does not want to see her sin in the flesh, for she says bearing the girl was her only sin. The father sent the priest to convince her, who revealed her heritage, but it fell on deaf ears. Later the mother fell on her knees to beg the daughter to take the vows, explaining the story enough to make Suzanne resign herself to her fate, realizing that her mother would never give her a chance to marry because the mother did not feel she was worthy to marry and the family could not afford to marry her off. She, according to the mother, did not have the bloodline to marry. She wrote her mother a letter that said she would take the vows, a letter that would be used against her later in the court case she wages against the church to be released of her vows. She allows herself to be dressed in a wedding gown and takes the vows. The young woman enters the convent, extremely depressed and unresponsive, unable to cope with the requirements of being a nun. She bonds to the Mother Superior, who takes her under her wing, and they have many long conversations. The Mother Superior, Mme de Moni, knows it’s a mistake to accept the girl as a nun but does not stop it, instead telling the girl to accept her fate and make the best of it. Suzanne attempts to, which is made easier by Mme de Moni’s encouragement, and does not utter more words but her body language reveals all. During this time, Suzanne’s mother dies, and Mme de Moni does as well. She bears it until the life finally drives her mad, for the new Mother Superior, Sister Sainte-Christine, mistreats her because of her rebellion as a result of her dislike of the nun’s life. She isolates her constantly and deprives her of food, forcing her to a diet of bread and water. Suzanne then sends her friend away with a letter to a lawyer. She wants to be free and absolved of her vows under the argument that everyone around her forced her to take the vows against her will: her mother, her father, the Mother Superior, etc. The lawyer, who becomes her biggest advocate against the religious orthodoxy enslaving her, informs her that while the case is pending, she will have to stay with Sister Sainte-Christine and endure the resulting persecution, but that either she will win or be transferred. Suzanne doesn’t care, not truly understanding the depths of Sister Sainte-Christine’ cruelty. While the case pends, Suzanne suffers such mistreatments under Sister Sainte-Christine, who steals her crucifix, forbids her to eat, forbids her to pray, forbids the other sisters to interact with or speak to her, and isolates her. She allows them to walk on the weakened, starving Suzanne after Mass. She is also whipped. They become convinced she is possessed, and Sister Sainte-Christine requests an exorcist. Officials arrive, see her mistreatment and understand that her devotion to God is not the way a possessed person would act, and investigate the mistreatment, which involves Sister Sainte-Christine’s being reprimanded. After that, Sister Sainte-Christine lessens the punishment to only isolation but still treats her coldly. When Suzanne discovers that the church decided not to absolve her vows, she once again falls into a severe depression. Her lawyer apologizes and promises to keep in touch, although a church official forbids the contact. The same man later tells her that the church transferred her to another convent under the supervision of Mme de Chelles. In addition to long conversations about her thoughts and experiences, the light-hearted, fun, happy Mme de Chelle displays homosexual tendencies towards Suzanne, which Suzanne never fully grasps. She meets a monk who attempts to comfort her by saying that he was forced into religion against his will as well. They develop a relationship and he later tells her that they must escape together. Suzanne goes with him, but flees from him when he forces kisses on her as soon as they are together which implies he desires more with her. Suzanne finds refuge nearby, working as a seamstress and doing chores for women. While there, she learns that the monk was caught and faces life in prison, same as she does. She cannot bear the thought of returning. She flees the small village she has taken refuge in and winds up begging on the street. Someone gives her money and then a place to stay. They host a party, where she discovers her lawyer is dead. She later attends a costume party with the people. In the middle of it she asks God to forgive her and commits suicide by throwing herself out of the window.',\n",

       "  'Mahmud Nasir  is a loving husband, doting father and a \"relaxed\" British Muslim who frequently listens to rock music, particularly the long deceased pop star Gary Page ([[James Floyd , and occasionally drinks alcohol. His son, Rashid, wishes to get married to Uzma, but he and Uzma need the blessing of her devout Muslim cleric stepfather, Arshad Al-Masri , whose actions and beliefs have earned him the contempt of many British Muslims. Mahmud reluctantly agrees to put on the act of devout Muslim for the occasion. Things change when Mahmud, while clearing out his recently deceased mother\\'s house, stumbles across an adoption certificate. Mahmud learns he was actually adopted by his Muslim parents when he was two weeks old, his birth parents are Jewish, and his real name is Solly Shimshillewitz. This comes as a shock to Mahmud, who is somewhat anti-Semitic, exemplified by his relationship with his American Jewish neighbour, Leonard \"Lenny\" Goldberg . His wife suspects his strange behaviour may be due to Mahmud being gay and speaks to the imam of their local mosque. The imam tells Mahmud that the Koran permits a man to sleep with another man. During an argument with Lenny, Mahmud lets slip his religion and his real name, and Lenny mentions a similarity to the name, Izzy Shimshillewitz, Mahmud\\'s biological father. Mahmud tracks his father to a Jewish old age home. He tries to visit, but a rabbi  guarding Izzy\\'s soul refuses him entry, saying it would be a shock for Izzy, a Jewish man, to see his son, a Muslim, and advises him to learn to act more like a Jew if he desires to see his father. Lenny agrees to teach Mahmud what he knows about being a Jew, such as dancing like Topol and learning basic Yiddish, but the frequent trips to Lenny\\'s house arouse Mahmud\\'s family\\'s suspicions, especially when Mahmud\\'s kippah is seen during a Muslim rally. Mahmud publicly burns the kippah in desperation as a symbol of his supposed hatred for Jews. Mahmud later attends a Bar Mitzvah with Lenny and unintentionally tells a very crude joke to the audience in broken Yiddish, only to be greeted with laughter from the attendees. Mahmud and Lenny eventually attempt to see Izzy, but the rabbi still refuses to let Mahmud inside when he cannot say his Jewish Sh\\'ma or name the Five Books of Moses in Hebrew. On the way home, Mahmud and Lenny have a bitter argument and Mahmud storms off, vowing to tell his family the truth immediately, but when he gets home, he sees that Arshad, Uzma and their friends are already there on a visit. Arshad, impressed with Mahmud\\'s supposed devotion to Islam after seeing him burn the kippah, proudly gives his blessing to Rashid and Uzma\\'s union, but the police arrive, along with a crowd of angry Jews and supportive Muslims, to arrest Mahmud for his racist remarks while burning the kippah. In desperation, he yells out in front of everyone that he is Jewish, exonerating him of the crime. A disgusted Arshad leaves with Uzma and his friends. Mahmud\\'s family leaves him for his dishonesty, one of his colleagues at work resigns, and he starts drinking. He becomes almost suicidal but is found and rescued by Lenny, who saw his announcement on the news. Mahmud angrily goes to the old age home and demands to see his father, but learns that his father has already died. Heartbroken, Mahmud is allowed inside Izzy\\'s room where he finds a video of his announcement in Izzy\\'s video machine, which Lenny had sent Izzy. Mahmud\\'s only solace is a sticker on the video with the name \"Solly\" on it, indicating that even after all these years, Izzy still remembered his long-lost son. Mahmud appears at Arshad\\'s next rally and delivers a speech on behalf of himself, Jewish citizens and Muslims. Mahmud also tells the crowd that Arshad is actually Gary Page, who staged his own death following his fall from fame after a racist remark, and resurfaced as a devout Muslim cleric and whose parents were scientologists. Arshad escapes from the rally, comically dressed in his old Gary Page clothes. In the end, Rashid and Uzma are married in a Pakistani Interfaith wedding, attended by both Muslims and Jews.',\n",

       "  'The opening countertop finds Junior Asparagus filling in for Larry the Cucumber, who is sleeping in today . Junior and Bob the Tomato field a question for Victor from Sausalito, California about obedience. Using their imaginations, Bob and Junior are transported to the Holy Land so that they can tell the show\\'s story. Bob acts as narrator and provides Junior with some background information. The Israelites, having been held as slaves in Egypt, are liberated by Moses  and led to the Promised Land. However, they question God\\'s methods and are prevented from entering the Promised Land for 40 years. Upon the completion of their exile, Moses has already died, and Joshua  has become leader of the Israelites. With everybody eager to finally reach the Promised Land after four decades of waiting, Joshua leads the Israelites to their new home, but are halted in their tracks by one big obstacle — the city of Jericho. The story is interrupted here for Silly Songs with Larry. \"Song of the Cebu\", introduced as a \"sequential image, stereophonic, multimedia event\", finds Larry on the countertop with a slide projector and a captive audience . The song, about a boy and three cebus  frequently goes off track and is interrupted several times by Archibald Asparagus. When the song ends abruptly and without any sort of conclusion, Archibald is furious and threatens to inform Bob about this utter failure of a song . When the story resumes, the Israelites are confronted by the defenders of Jericho , who taunt them from atop the city\\'s great wall. Joshua explains that God has given this land to the Israelites and that therefore the defenders will have to step aside. They are met by more insults and smug jeering. When a slushy drink accidentally falls and hits Jimmy, they fall back and regroup. That night, the Israelites argue about what to do. Pa Grape wants to go back to Egypt, while Jimmy and Jerry are convinced that they need heavy firepower to destroy the wall and run off to construct their weapon. Trying to escape the arguing, Joshua wanders off in hopes that he can hear God for advice. During his solitude, Joshua meets the Commander of the Army of the Lord , who tells him how the Israelites are to take Jericho: they must march around the city once a day for six days, then on the seventh day they are to march around it seven times, blow their horns, and all yell at the same time. At this point, the messenger states, the walls of Jericho will fall. Joshua reports the plan to the rest of the Israelites the next morning. Naturally, this plan leads to some serious doubts. Jimmy and Jerry then show off their alternate plan: a giant rocket named \"The Wallminator 3000\" which the Israelites applaude . Joshua, however, insists that they agree to try it God\\'s way, and they all proceed to Jericho. As the Israelites march around the wall, the city\\'s defenders insult them all the more, turning their taunts into a choreographed musical number while the Israelites try to ignore them. However, the taunting turns to semi-frozen carnage when the Jericho defenders bombard the Israelites with slushy drinks. The end of the day finds Joshua facing the threat of mutiny from the slushy-soaked Israelites, with some ready to fire up the Wallminator and others ready to run back to Egypt. At this point, Junior intervenes and convinces them to continue with the plan God laid out. He explains that God\\'s way doesn\\'t always make sense, but provides examples of how it always works out in the end. Inspired by Junior\\'s example, the Israelites agree to stick with the plan and, in spite of renewed and constant counter-attacks, march around the city for seven days as specified. On the seventh day they blow their horns and scream: at first nothing happens, but then cracks appear and the walls crashes down, just as God said it would. Joshua claims the land for his people, the defenders run away in panic, and the Israelites are finally allowed into the Promised Land. Bob and Junior wrap up on the closing countertop, reiterating the lesson in the film in that though God\\'s way may not always make sense, His way of doing things is always the best way.

The shooter is Humbert Humbert , a 40-something British professor of French literature. Four years earlier, Humbert arrives in Ramsdale, New Hampshire, intending to spend the summer before his professorship begins at Beardsley College, Ohio. He searches for a room to let, and Charlotte Haze , a blowsy, sexually frustrated widow, invites him to stay at her house. He declines until seeing her daughter, Dolores , affectionately called \"Lolita\". Lolita is a soda-pop drinking, gum-snapping, overtly flirtatious teenager, with whom Humbert falls in love. To be close to Lolita, Humbert accepts Charlotte\\'s offer and becomes a lodger in the Haze household, but Charlotte wants all of \"Hum\\'s\" time for herself and soon announces that she will be sending Lolita to an all-girl sleepaway camp for the summer. After the Hazes depart for camp, the maid gives Humbert a letter from Charlotte, confessing her love for him and demanding he vacate at once unless he feels the same way. The letter says that if Humbert is still in the house when she returns, Charlotte will know that her love is requited, and he must marry her. Though he roars with laughter while reading the sadly heartfelt yet characteristically overblown letter, Humbert marries Charlotte. Things turn sour for the couple in the absence of Lolita. Humbert becomes more withdrawn while Charlotte becomes more whiny. Charlotte then discovers Humbert’s diary entries detailing his passion for Lolita and characterizing her as \"the Haze woman, the cow, the obnoxious mama, the brainless baba\". She has an hysterical outburst and, while Humbert hurriedly fixes martinis in the kitchen to smooth over the situation, she runs outside, is hit by a car, and dies. Humbert drives to the camp to pick up Lolita, who doesn\\'t yet know her mother is dead. They stay the night in a hotel that is handling an overflow influx of police officers attending a convention. One of the guests, Quilty, pretends to be a policeman and insinuates himself upon Humbert and keeps steering the conversation to his \"beautiful little daughter,\" who is asleep upstairs, while repeating, too often, that he thinks Humbert is \"normal.\" Humbert escapes the Quilty\\'s advances, and, the next morning, Humbert and Lolita enter into a sexual relationship. The two commence an odyssey across the United States, traveling from hotel to motel. In public, they act as father and daughter. After several days, Humbert tells Lolita that her mother is not sick in a hospital, as he had previously told her, but dead. Grief-stricken, she stays with Humbert. In the fall, Humbert reports to his position at Beardsley College, and enrolls Lolita in high school there. Before long, people begin to wonder about the relationship between father and his over-protected daughter. Humbert worries about her involvement with the school play and with male classmates. One night he returns home to find Dr. Zempf, a pushy, abrasive stranger, sitting in his darkened living room. Zempf, speaking with a thick German accent, claims to be from Lolita\\'s school and wants to discuss her knowledge of \"the facts of life.\" Humbert is frightened and decides to take Lolita on the road again. He soon realizes they are being followed by a mysterious car that never drops away but never quite catches up. When Lolita becomes sick, he takes her to the hospital. However, when he returns to pick her up, she is gone. The nurse  there tells him she left with another man claiming to be her uncle and Humbert, devastated, is left without a single clue as to her disappearance or whereabouts. Some years later, Humbert receives a letter from Mrs. Richard T. Schiller, Lolita\\'s married name. She writes that she is now married to a man named Dick , and that she is pregnant and in desperate need of money. Humbert travels to their home and finds that she is now a roundly, expectant woman in glasses leading a pleasant, humdrum life. Humbert demands that she tell him who kidnapped her three years earlier. She tells him it was Clare Quilty, the man that was following them, who is a famous playwright and with whom her mother had a fling in Ramsdale days. She states Quilty is also the one who disguised himself as the policeman and Dr. Zempf as well as well as the anonymous phone caller from earlier. Lolita herself carried on an affair with him and left with him when he promised her glamor. However, he then demanded she join his depraved lifestyle, including acting in his \"art\" films.

During the night, visitors from Bangkok attack Ting's uncle and steal the statue's head which Ting promises to recover. In the city, Ting meets with his cousin Humlae who has dyed his hair blond and begun calling himself George. He and his friend, Muay Lek, are street-bike racing hustlers who have fallen in with a bad crowd of yaba dealers. They find that they speak the same Isaan dialect. Humlae is at first reluctant to help Ting, but when he sees the small fortune in coins that Ting has collected from his village, Humlae takes an immediate interest. When Ting is in the bathroom, Humlae grabs the sack and heads for a bar on Khaosan Road where an illegal boxing match is going on. Ting tracks Humlae down, but instead of getting his money back, he ends up fighting and being named the new champion.Ting's unexpected skill takes the gambling crowd by surprise and this makes Ting an enemy of Komtuan, a gray-haired, wheelchair-bound crimelord who needs an electrolarynx to speak. It is discovered that Ong-Bak was actually stolen by one of his henchmen, Don. George and Muay Lek begin working a scam at a baccarat game in an illegal casino. When the scam is discovered, a drug dealer punishes George with a beating. Ting ignores George's cries for help, but intervenes when the drug dealer attacks Muay Lek. When additional henchmen arrive, a footchase through the alleys ensues. Ting helps George escape in exchange for his assistance in helping to find Don. That night, Ting's skills are showcased once again when a fight breaks out at the bar. After many opponents are wounded, Komtuan tries to have Ting killed.

After dispatching many of the drivers, Ting ends up at a port in the Chao Phraya River, where he discovers a cache of stolen Buddha images.

There is a final showdown, with Ting fighting off all of Komtuan's henchmen and George trying his best to help. Komtuan's bodyguard launches into a second drug-crazed fight with Ting but is defeated.

Komtuan is killed instantly but George is left with enough strength to utter a dying wish - for Muay Lek to graduate school and for Ting to look after her. The head of the Ong-Bak Buddha statue is restored in the temple of Ting's village. Ting, now ordained as a monk with shaven head and white robes, arrives into the village in a procession on an elephant's back while the villagers and Muay Lek celebrate his ordination.\",\n",

Mrs. Saunders pledges to raise the \"poor little darling\" as her own, alongside her own son Jimmie. She names her Naomi.

This looks true the day Naomi disappears on her way to school and Jimmie tells his mother that Naomi deliberately avoided the black school she was supposed to attend and instead went to attend a white school. Naomi denies Jimmie\\'s accusation, saying he\\'s lying because he hates girls. When Mrs. Cushinberry threatens to punish her for being insolent and mean, Naomi furiously explodes that she hates her and the other children and that she only came to the school because her mother sent her there. She spits in the teacher\\'s face which results in Mrs. Cushinberry spanking her. That evening, Mrs. Cushinberry visits Mrs. Saunders, but when she realizes that Naomi didn\\'t tell her mother what happened that afternoon, she decides to keep silent.

       "  \"James Cole  is a convicted criminal living in a grim post-apocalyptic future. In 1996–97, the Earth's surface was contaminated by a virus so deadly that it forced the surviving population to live underground. At some point in the years that followed, scientists have engineered an imprecise form of time travel. To earn a pardon, Cole allows scientists to send him on dangerous missions to the past to collect information on the virus, thought to be released by a terrorist organization known as the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. If possible, he is to obtain a pure sample of the original virus so a cure can be made. Throughout the film, Cole is troubled with recurring dreams involving a chase and a shooting in an airport. On Cole's first trip, he arrives in Baltimore in 1990, not 1996 as planned. He is arrested and hospitalized in a mental institution on the diagnosis of Dr. Kathryn Railly . There, he encounters Jeffrey Goines , a fellow mental patient with fanatical animal rights and anti-consumerist leanings. Cole tries unsuccessfully to leave a voicemail on a number monitored by the scientists in the future. After a failed escape attempt, Cole is restrained and locked in a cell, but then disappears, returning to the future. Back in his own time, Cole is interviewed by the scientists, who play a distorted voice mail message which gives the location of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys and states that they are responsible for the virus. He is also shown photos of numerous people suspected of being involved with the virus, including Goines. The scientists then send him back to 1996. Cole kidnaps Railly and sets out in search of Goines, learning that he is the founder of the Army of the Twelve Monkeys. When confronted, however, Goines denies any involvement with the virus and suggests that wiping out humanity was Cole's idea, originally broached at the asylum in 1990. Cole vanishes again as the police approach. After Cole disappears, Railly begins to doubt her diagnosis of Cole when she finds evidence that he is telling the truth, including a photograph from World War I in which Cole appears. Cole, on the other hand, convinces himself that his future experiences are hallucinations, and persuades the scientists to send him back again. Railly attempts to settle the question of Cole's sanity by leaving a voice mail on the number he provided, creating the message the scientists played prior to his second mission. They both now realize that the coming plague is real, and make plans to enjoy the time they have left. On their way to the airport, they learn that the Army of the Twelve Monkeys is a red herring; all the Army has done is delay traffic by releasing all the animals in the zoo. At the airport, Cole leaves a last message telling the scientists they are on the wrong track following the Army of the Twelve Monkeys, and that he will not return. He is soon confronted by Jose , an acquaintance from his own time, who gives Cole a handgun and instructions to complete his mission. At the same time, Railly spots the true culprit behind the virus: Dr. Peters ([[David Morse , an assistant at the virology lab run by Jeffrey's father. Peters is about to embark on a tour of several cities around the world, which matches the sequence  of viral outbreaks. After forcing his way through the security checkpoint in pursuit of Peters, Cole is fatally shot by police. As Cole dies in Railly's arms, she makes eye contact with a small boy: the young James Cole witnessing the scene of his own death, which will replay in his dreams for years to come. Dr. Peters, aboard the plane with the virus, sits down next to Jones , one of the lead scientists from the future.\",\n",
